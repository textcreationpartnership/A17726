            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F anye man maruell, my dere brethren and companions in the worcke of the Lorde, that I wyll occupie my ſelfe to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere vnto a boke whyche is vnworthy to be ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, or to be made mencion of, ſeinge that I maye oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupye my ſelfe, as men thincke, in beter thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and thynges of more frute, it ſhalbe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiente excuſe for me to alledge that I haue done it at the requeſt and inſtaunce of manye good fayethful men, wyth ſente the boke to me from far countries, which teſtimonie that it was verye nedefull for the helth of many ſoules, that I ſhoulde take it in hand. For I thincke verelye that this ſhould be ſufficient to contente them that be reſonable, that my intente was to obtayne as well to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes as to the deſires of them whiche I knewe to be zelous for the glory of God and the edification of his people. But yet haue I an other anſwere for to excuſe me by, to them which may thinke that it is foly in me, to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie my ſelfe in a thyng ſo barren and trife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge, as is thys little boke, which apereth to be made by ignoraunte people: which is, that we haue no greater priuyledge than had the prophetes of God, and that oure payne is no
<pb facs="tcp:11396:3"/> more preciouſe, than was theirs. Nowe we ſe that Ezechiel was conſtrayned to ſpeake and write not only agaynſt diſceiuers which were ignoraunte and of no reputacion, but alſo agaynſte women which woulde be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſſes. Seynge the prophet ſpared not to diſpute agaynſte women, ye and that it was commaunded hym by God ſo to do, becauſe thorow their leaſynges they led the people to ſuperſticio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and erroure, and letted the veritie of his courſe: it ſhould be a preſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption to vs, not to wytſafe to do the lyke. It is trewe that thys boke, whiche I am deſired and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to confute, hath no nede of reſolution towardes them that haue learnynge and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandynge: for as muche as of it ſelfe it is ſufficientelye reproued, in that it is ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learnedly &amp; foliſhly written. But for as much as it hath a certayne coloure to abuſe and cir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cumuente the ſimple, which haue not the iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gemente to diſcerne: oure dutye is to helpe them, and aduertiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the malicious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telties of ſathan, to the intente that they be not thorow imprudence diſceiued: we are det<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tours to one and other ſayeth ſanicte Paule. Therefore we muſte do ſeruice vnto all as muche as in vs is, ſpecially whan neceſſitye requireth it. I proteſt therfore, that myne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencion is onlye in ſhorte or fewe wordes, to ſhewe vnto all fayethfull chriſten men which be rude and vnlerned, what and how dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a poyſon thys doctrine of the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtes is: and alſo arme them by the word of God agaynſte the ſame, to the ende that
<pb facs="tcp:11396:3"/> they be not diſceyued or if ther be any, which all redy be wrapped in their ſnares, that they may be brought agayne vnto the ryght way. Wherefore I beſeche all them whiche deſire to continew in the pure knowledge of Ieſus Chriſte, and in the obedience of his Goſpel, to take paynes to rede attentiuely thys little boke, euen as I haue dedicated it vnto them: and alſo take the paynes well to peyſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonnes whiche I do alledge vnto them: that they maye abyde in the trueth whan it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto them. Therefore reaſon whyche moued me to dedicate this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t treatiſe vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to you, is double. Fyrſte, bycauſe it ſhoulde be a publyke teſtimonie of the coniunction whiche I haue and deſier alwayes to haue wyth you: and that al menne myghte knowe howe we are vnited as wel in doctrine as in affection of herte. The ſeconde is, to the ende that the redynge thereof myghte be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter commended and receyued of all them ouer whom you haue charge to bere the worde of Ieſus Chriſte: in ſuche ſorte that the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ouer whych the prynce of paſtours hath made your miniſters, maye be intertayned in pure doctrine, and preſerued from al peruerſe opinions, contrarying the truth of the goſpel It is true, that you myght right well (my dere brethren) haue diſcharged me of thys payne. And alſo, alredye oure brother. M. Wyllyam Farell, accordynge vnto the grace whyche God hathe geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, and the exerſies whiche he hath of longe tyme had, and continual cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume in fyghtyng aſtaynſte the ennemyes of
<pb facs="tcp:11396:4"/> the trueth, and reſiſtynge all falſe doctrines for to mayntayne Chriſtes kyngedome, hath well ſatiſfied you in parte, in that thynge whyche you nowe require of me. As I haue ſene by the actes of a diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> done in the good towne. In ſuch ſorte that of thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles whyche are there treated, no man can deſyre a more ſuffitiente declaration, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfy hys conſcience, then is ther geuen. But bycauſe they vnto whome I deſyre and am bound to do ſeruice, do make me beleue that it is neceſſarie that I take thys charge vpon me, I wyll conſent vnto theyr requeſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out makynge any longer excuſes. The Lord Ieſus Chriſte haue you alwayes in hys ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye protection, and hys churches whiche he hathe committed vnto you: and leade you by hys holye ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite alwayes: for to ſerue hym with youre miniſterye vnto hys honoure and vnto the healthe of hys pore people.

<pb facs="tcp:11396:5"/> them by any certayne order, But bycauſe the pryncipall doctours, and as it were the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes of the whole Sinagoge, after they had well ranged aboute, haue made a fynall concluſion, wherein they comprehende the ſome of al that whych they do holde againſt vs, and the Papiſtes in ſeuen Articles: vnto whyche al Anabaptiſtes communely cleaue: in ſo muche that they haue founde the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to cauſe thys fayre reſolution to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prynted, and haue togyther agreed to ſowe theyr poyſon by it all abrode: and ſo to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte the pore people: I wyl be contented for thys tyme, and I thinke alſo that it ſhal ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffyce, to declare the falſeheade contayned in the moſt parte of theſe ſeuen Articles: to the intente that they do not complayne and ſaye that I laye that to the charge of theym all, whych is done but of ſome particulars, &amp; ſo vniuſtly defame the whole ſecte, Thys once done, if I maye haue at any time leaſure, I wil write ſome other litle treatiſe, agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt the other ſeconde ſorte, of whyche I ſpake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that is the Libertines, But as I haue ſayde, it ſhall be ſufficiente for thys tyme, to declare vnto all louers of the trueth, that, that thynge whyche theſe poore people with one common accorde holde for a foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inuincible, of theyr fayth, is a deadly abuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of the which we muſt beware, as we would be of the peſtelence.</p>
            <p>I ſpeke to al the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which deſire to be obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto the truth For ther be ſome of this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiouſe ſecte, and chyefelye thoſe whyche
<pb facs="tcp:11396:6"/> do counterfayte the doctoures: the whyche beynge occupied wyth pryde and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſe nothynge of thoſe thynges whyche is ſayde vnto them, or rather thorowe obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and deliberate malyce ſhutte theyr eyes, bycauſe they wyll not ſe the lyghte, when it is ſo euidently offred to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In ſo much y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is as vnprofitable a laboure, as to beate the water when you woulde haue it ſtyl, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to bring them to the ryght waye, ſaue that thys profite wyl come therof, that they whyche be good ſhal know the deſperate impudency, and ſo wythdraw them ſelues, &amp; ffye from them, as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poyſon.</p>
            <p>Nowe bycauſe there is no fayrer coloure to ſeduce the chriſtians whych haue a zele to folowe God, then to pretend his holy word, therefore the Anabaptiſtes agaynſte whome we nowe wryte, haue alwayes that preface in theyr mouthe. And truly when it is ſayed, that it is God whych ſpeaketh: al creatures ought to be moued, for the reuerence of hys name, in humilitie to here what is ſayed. When we perceiue that is the word of God in dede, which is ſette before vs: there is no more queſtion to replye, or once to open oure mouthes to diſpute agaynſte it. We do not ſaye as the papiſtes do, that we muſt forſake the ſcriptures of God, and ſtaye oure ſelues in the authoritie of men. For we hold that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaſion, for an execrable blaſphemy. But we wyll that whyche appeareth to come frome God, &amp; leaneth to his word, be receiued to vs wyth al humilitie, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out any controuerſitie
<pb facs="tcp:11396:6"/> or difficultie. And more ouer we thinke that none other doctrine ſhuld be receiued for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain &amp; true, but ſuch as cometh out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of al trueth. Therfore be they Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtes, or other, whiche ſay vnto vs, that that thing whiche they bringe vnto vs, they haue receyued of God, and taken it of his mouth: that is to ſaye, that they haue it oute of the bleſſed ſcripture: lette vs geue this glorye to God, modeſteouſlye to vnderſtande and her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken whether it ſo be or not. But as it is our duty to herken vnto theſe thinges which are ſaid, vnto ſuch time as we do know what it is: ſo ought we to haue thys prudence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne betwene the trueth and lyinge: and to iudge whether it be ſo, or otherwiſe, whyche is alledged oute of the word of God. For it is commaunded vs to proue the ſpirits, and to know whether they be of God or no. And trulye we ſe how neceſſarie this is for vs: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng the deuil him ſelfe was armed with the word of god, and made a weapon thereof to aſſaulte our Lord Ieſus.

                  <p>¶ That is theyr ſayinge. But fyrſte I Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that the Baptiſinge of yong chyldren is not a thynge newlye brought vp, neyther a thynge whyche toke hys begynnyng in the Papaſie. For I ſay that it hath bene a holy ordinaunce kepte alwayes in the Chriſtian churche. And that thys is true, there is no doctour ſo auncient, whyche doeth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that it hathe bene alwayes vſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the tyme of the Apoſtles. I thought it good to ſaye thys much by the waye, and for none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe, but to infourme the ſimple, that it is an impudent ſclaunder of theſe phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall men, whiche woulde make men beleue that this auncient obſeruation is a ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on newlye forged: and that is come from the pope: wher as in dede the whole church vſed it before there was any Pope, or that anye man hearde ſpeake of the pope. Beſides this I wyll not that the auntientie thereof ſhal helpe vs any thynge to the probation therof
<pb facs="tcp:11396:8"/> excepte it be tounde grounded in the worde of God. I know that as the cuſtome of men geueth not authoritie vnto the ſacramentes: euen ſo to vſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> well, we ought not to take our rule accordyng to the ſame. Let vs come then vnto the true rule of God whyche we haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of: that is to ſay, vnto his worde whych onely here ought to take place. Their intente is, that baptiſme ſhoulde not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate but to hym that aſketh it, makyng profeſſion of fayeth and repentaunce. And therfore the baptiſme of little chyldren is an inuention of man againſte the word of god.</p>
                  <p>To proue thys, they aledge the place oute of S. Mathewe, where oure ſauiour Ieſus Chriſte ſayeth vnto hys Apoſtles. Go, and teache all people, baptiſynge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the name of the father, &amp; of the ſonne, and of the holye goſt: vnto whiche, they do adde this ſentence out of the .xvi. chap. of. S. Marke. He that ſhal beleue and ſhall be baptiſed, ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Thys is, as they thynke, an inuincible fundation. To thys I anſwere, that in theſe places there is nothynge ſpoken of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, but inſidentlye. For it is put there as an acceſſarie of the preaching of the Goſpel. Our lord Ieſus ſent his Apoſtles to preach and inſtruct the world, &amp; added baptiſme for a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their doctrine. Therefore is it to be noted, that for thys cauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine ought to go before this ſacrament, which is added vnto it, as the ſeale thereof. In thys thing we agre. But you muſte know howe.</p>
                  <p>And this thinge is it whiche abuſeth theſe
<pb facs="tcp:11396:8"/> pore phantaſticals, that they do not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the men. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is an eſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> church: as a Turke, a Iewe, or any other heythe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for to make hym a chriſtian, it is wythoute queſtion that we ought not to begynne wyth hym fyrſt by baptiſme, but before he be baptiſed, he muſte be inſtructed. And ſuch was the vſage of the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t church. For they which were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto Chriſt, had for a certain time, their predication apart, whiche was called Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme. And afterward, hauing teſtimony of their faith &amp; repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taunce, they were baptiſed. Reaſon would it thus. For ſeing that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not onelye introduced by baptiſme into the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the churche, but alſo hath there his atteſtation ſealed, that god doth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him for one of his children: there is no doubte but that the doctrine ought to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: by which the man ought to be taught to conuert him felfe to god with faith &amp; repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. We ſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god did ſo w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when he was circumciſed. For before he dyd inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute that ſigne for h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m, he receyued him into his couenaunt, &amp; inſtructed him in his word.</p>
                  <p>And we muſte alſo note this, that when a man is receyued of god into the company of the fayethful: the promiſe of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is made to hym: is not onely for hys perſon, but alſo for hys chyldren. For it is ſaied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym. I am thy God, and the God of thy chyldren after the. So nowe a man whyche from hys infancy, was not receiued into the couenaunte of God, is as a ſtraunger frome
<pb facs="tcp:11396:9"/> the church, vnto ſuch tyme as by the doctrine of ſaluation he be broughte vnto fayeth and repentaunce. But than hys ſeede is made by and by of the howſhoulde of the church. And for thys cauſe are the little children of fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men, baptiſed in the vertue of thys conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunte which is made wyth their fathers in their name and to their profite. Here you ſe wher the Anabaptiſtes are diſceyued. That the doctrine ought to procede the ſacrament, we do not reſiſte. But the hole matter is as we haue ſayed, to conſider how, and by what men. For whan the queſtion is, of a man in age to be baptiſed, which was before no chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: before he be chriſtened, he muſt be taught thoſe thynges whyche be figured by baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. But as touchyng hys chyldre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they ſhalbe baptiſed vpon the doctrine whyche he hath receyued: whyche doeth contayne that God ſhalbe a ſauioure not onely of his perſon but alſo of hys children. To make it ſomewhat playne to the vnderſtandynge: whan a man whyche was a ſtraunger to the companye of the fayethfull, is conuerted vnto God, the doctrine vpon whyche he is baptiſed is ſette forth vnto hym: and therefore it is neceſſarye that he vnderſtand it, and comprehende it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be receyued vnto the ſacramente. The doctrine vpon whyche the yonge children of chriſten men be bapiiſed is not ſetforth to them, but to their parentes, and to the whole churche: and therfore it is not requiſite that they vnderſtande it, before they do receyue the ſygne.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11396:9"/>
                  <p>☞ Therefore whan men make thys argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente: oure Lorde comaunded hys Apoſtles to preach before they baptiſed: and hath ſayd, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he which ſhal beleue &amp; ſhalbe baptiſed, ſhal be ſaued: and therefore it foloweth: that none ought to be admited to the ſacrament of bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſme, but he that all redie beleueth. This is a noughtie concluſion. For it is verye nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that oure Lorde in thoſe places ſpeketh not, but of them whiche are of age mete to be taughte, and whiche were not before of the chriſten churche. If we take not hede vnto ſuche circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtaunces; we ſhal confounde many places in ſcriptures, and ſhall be confuſed when we do expound them. It is ſayed that he whyche dothe not laboure, ſhall not eate, and yet there is no man ſo cruell as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne lyttle infantes to dye for hunger. For euerye man ſeeth clearlye, that the Apoſtles putte not them in this order, but ſpeake one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſuche as be ſtronge, and be able. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge then, that oure Lorde in theſe places, doeth make ſpeciall mention of thoſe which are apte to be taughte, and whyche were not before of hys diſciples, it is a deprauation, and peruertynge of ſcripture, to applye theſe places vnto the yonge chyldren of chriſtian me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which, haue not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> capaciti to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and be already co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended within the coue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>naunt of god, made vnto theyr fathers, that they ſhould be of the houſhold of the church.</p>
                  <p>Theſe phantaſticall men, aledge yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for them, the vſe and practiſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtles. It is written in the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the Actes,
<pb facs="tcp:11396:10"/> that the foure thouſand men of Hieruſalem, after that they had heard ſaint Peter preach beyng touched in theyr hertes, dyd axe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell what they oughte to do: and that ſaynte Peter anſwered them: repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t you, and beleue the Goſpell. Furthermore, when the Eunu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus required to be baptiſed. Phyllype an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered hym, that he myght be baptiſed if ſo be that he beleued wyth hys whole herte. And out of thys they conclude that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles required that men ſhoulde haue fayeth and repentaunce, before they were baptiſed. I graunte it to be true of ſuche men whyche muſte be receyued a newe into the communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Chriſtian churche: but touchyng thoſe chyldren whiche are of the church before they iſſue out of theyr mother bealies, I ſay there is an other reaſon. For theyr fathers &amp; aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetoures receyued the promiſe, vpon whyche their Baptiſme is founded. It was therefore neceſſarie, that the inhabitau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, which were out of the chriſtian church, and whych conſented vnto the death of oure Lorde, ſhoulde haue true repentaunce, before they ſhoulde haue teſtimonie thorow baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, that the Lorde Ieſus did accept them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the numbre of hys faithfull. It was nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſarie that the Eunuchus ſhould come vnto the flocke of Chriſte by true fayeth, before he ſhoulde receyue the ſygne therof. But ſeynge thys promiſe is made vnto all fayethful me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: I am the God of thy ofſprynge: the children whyche deſcende of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> haue an other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueledge: whyche is, that God doeth knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb facs="tcp:11396:10"/> theym for hys, for their fathers ſakes. And leſte it ſhoulde appere, that I do fayne this as a dreame, out of myne owne heade: you maye ſee that God hath ſhowed the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſample in Iſaac. It is true as we haue ſayd that Abraham was inſtructed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine, of fayth and of repentaunce, before he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the ſygne of Circumſicion. But after that God had receiued hym into hys church, he ordeyned that hys ofſprynge ſhoulde bee partakers of that benefit. And ſo Iſaac and all his other ſucceſſours were Circumciſed in their infancie. So nowe we haue God for oure authoure of this difference: vppon the whiche dependeth all the difficultie of thys queſtion.</p>
                  <p>☞ But becauſe they wyll not admyt thys ſimilitude whyche we brynge, betwene Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſicion and Baptyſme, it ſhalbe expedient to ſhowe, before we go anye further, that it is one thyng. When we ſpeake of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we muſt conſider that the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce and propertie, oughte to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande of the doctrine, whereof the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a confirmation. Let vs then marke this, that the doctryne is as the principall: and the Sacrament is as acceſſarie. Nowe let vs make compariſon of Baptyſme with Circumſicion. ☞ Baptiſme importeth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, or renewynge of lyfe: wyth promeſſe of the forgeuenes of our ſynnes.</p>
                  <p>Cyrcumſicion doth importe aſmuche and neyther more nor leſſe. That thys is trewe, towching repentaunce, it is euyde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as wel in
<pb facs="tcp:11396:11"/> the bokes of Moyſes as in the Prophetes, wher it is ſpoken of the circumciſion of oure hertes. For that is that thynge, whiche the newe teſtamente calleth mortification of the olde man. In ſumma, ſpirituall circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is as muche to ſaye as, repentaunce. And for the ſeconde parte, whyche is the promes of forgeuenes of ſynnes, we canne haue no clearer probacion than thys ſentence of. S. Paulle, where he ſayeth, that circumciſion was geuen to Abraham for a confirmacion, of the ryghtwyſnes, which he frely obtayned of God, thorowe fayeth. If nowe, men make thys argumente: that it is agaynſte reaſon, that lyttel children, whiche haue neyther fayth nor repentaunce, ſhould be baptiſed, for as muche as baptyme is a ſacrament of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and ſpiritual waſhinge whyche we haue in Ieſus Chriſte: I anſwere that the lyke maye be ſayde of circumciſion. And yet God commaunded that the younge infantes ſhoulde be circumciſed. And therefore it is as muche as to reaſon agaynſte God: whan we ſaye that it is agaynſte reaſon, that a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente whyche is a teſtimony of repentaunce, and ſaluacion, ſhoulde be communicate vnto younge children. What ſhall we ſaye then? Truelye, if we counte that good, which God hath done: we haue a leſſon, that it is not ned<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full that the veritye whyche is ſignified by the ſacramente, ſhoulde alwayes precede, but that it ſuffiſeth otherwhyle, that it folow, at the leſte in parte: for the renouacion of lyfe, was well ſignified by circumciſion: and ſo
<pb facs="tcp:11396:11"/> was lykewiſe the iuſtice whyche we obtaine by fayeth. Neyther repentaunce nor fayeth, was in the yong infantes: and yet were they not for fault therof, excluded from circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, whyche is the ſigne of the ſame. Nowe you ſe then, that the ſygne goth before the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of that ſygne. And if that thys were ſometyme lawfull, and conformable to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, howe commeth it nowe to paſſe that it ſhoulde be repugnaunte vnto the ſame. But here maye it be replied, that it is not inough to alledge that ſuche a thynge was done, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte we can ſhewe that we oughte ſo to do nowe. I graunte that true: neyther would I that the baptiſme of little chyldren ſhould be receyued as good, excepte I canne proue that Goddes wyll is that ſo it ſhoulde be, but in the meane while let vs holde faſte this thing whyche I haue alreadye proued: whyche is, that it is as much, as to reaſon agaynſt god, when we wyll alwayes haue, that the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ſhould precede the ſigne. Touching the reſt, we muſt proue that it is according with the worde of God, that we do baptiſe lyttle chyldren, whyche thynge ſhall be eaſye to all mens vnderſtandynge, wythoute longe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to declare the ſame: if we do knowe the grace and mercy whyche oure Lorde Ieſus hath done vnto vs at hys commynge. Afore that, God promiſed vnto the Iewes that the woulde be the God of their chyldren: and in wytnes therof he ſealed them wyth the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of hys couenaunt. Nowe as ſayeth ſaynt Paul, the Lorde Ieſus is come, for to ratifie hys promiſes made vnto the Iewes,
<pb facs="tcp:11396:12"/> and to ſhedde furthe into all the worlde the mercye of God. Yea, as it is euident in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther texte, he hath broken downe the walle whych ſtode betwene bothe, to ſeperate the one from the other: and this hath he doone, that there ſhoulde bee no more difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene them: but that we al together, ſhoulde haue one maner of priuiledge, to be the chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. Wherefore, whoſoeuer wyll make the grace of God leſſe towardes vs &amp; our chyldren, than it was towardes the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Iewes, doth great iniury vnto our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt, and blaſphemeth him. But ſome wyl ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the grace of God is not made leſſe towardes vs, in that our chyldren are not receyued to Baptiſme: ſo that we denye not, that God hath ſhewed vnto them lyke mercy, as vnto the chyldren of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes I anſwer, yeſſe. For we muſt eſteme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace of God, pryncipally by the declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he hath made vnto vs, aſwell by hys worde as by his ſacramentes. Seynge nowe, that Baptiſme at this daye, is ordayned to ſeale in our bodies the promes of ſaluation: as of olde tyme Circumſicion was vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Iewes: we ſhoulde take from the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s a ſynguler conſolation, if we take from their chyldren that confirmation, the whych the faythful haue alwayes had: that is, a viſible ſygne, by whych our Lord decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vnto theym, that he accepteth their chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren into the communion of his Church. ¶ I knowe the cauillation which the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſtes make in this place, takyng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name
<pb facs="tcp:11396:12"/> of chyldren allegoricallie, to ſignifie theym which are childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in maliſſe, and not in age. And therfore do mocke vs, bicauſe we are ſo ſymple to vnderſtande this after the lettre. But what ſubtiltie is this I praye you, to ouerwhelme thoſe playne and cleare promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: where it is ſaide, that God ſheddeth out hys mercy vpon the ſeede of the faythful af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their death? And on the other ſyde, what better and more certayne expoſition of thys thynge can we haue, than the holy gooſt? the whych by his apoſtles hath interpreted that which he had ſhowed before by his prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. Nowe ſaynt Peter dooth teſtifye vnto the Iewes, that they are chyldren of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes: that is to ſaye, heyres: foraſmuche as they become of Abrahams ſtocke. And ſaynt Paul, though of a deliberat purpoſe he figh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth agaynſt the foolyſhe preſumption of the Iewes, whych they had in their carnall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage: yet dooth he not denye, but that the ſtocke of Abraham is ſpecially ſanctified, by<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe and throughe the vertue of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt whyche GOD had made wyth hym. It is verie trewe, that whan the chyldren of the faythfull, ſhall come vnto the age of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, they maye alienate them ſelues from GOD, and adinchillate the vertue of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. Yet maye we not therefore ſaye, that our Lorde hath not choſen theym, and ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated theym from other, for to preſent vnto them hys ſaluation.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11396:13"/>
                  <p>Otherwiſe it ſhoulde be in vayne, that ſaint Paule ſayeth. That a chylde hauynge father or mother fayethfull is ſanctified whyche ſhould be vncleane, if he were begotten and diſcended of infidels. Seynge nowe that the holye goſte, authore and fountayne of all ſanctification, doth teſtifie that the child<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>en of chriſten me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are holy, may we exclude them from ſo great a benefite? Now if in them be the verity of baptiſme, howe can we depryue them of the ſygne, whyche is leſſe &amp; inferiour.</p>
                  <p>But they reply, that the cuſtome and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyſe of the Apoſtles is contrarie. For it is ſayed that Paule and Silas preached the worde of the Lorde, vnto the gealer, or keper of the pryſon, and to hys houſholde, before that they baptyſed them. I haue already ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſolution vnto this, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſhewed howe that to a man whyche is a ſtraunger frome the church, the doctrine ought to precede the ſacrament: but after that God hath receiued hym into the communion of hys fayethfull the promiſe of lyfe is made vnto hym as wel for hys chyldren, as for hym ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>But they thynke, in the .xix. of the Actes, to fynde in theyr fauoure a more expreſſe ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: where it is ſayd, that. S. Paule, hauing founde certayne diſciples, whyche had not yet receyued the holye Gooſte, dyd Baptiſe them anewe. Nowe is it very certayne that ſaint Luke, in that place, ſpeaketh of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible graces of the holye Gooſte. For other wyſe: that whych he ſayth could not ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither:
<pb facs="tcp:11396:13"/> that is, that theſe of whome he ſpake, whyche were Iewes, dyd anſwere that they knewe not whether the holy Goſte were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Nowe they could not be ignoraunt that God doeth ſanctifie hys ſeruauntes by hys ſpirite: ſeynge that ther is ſo often made me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof in the prophetes. But they knew not whether theſe graces wherof. S. Paule ſpake, were geuen vnto the chriſtian church. Nowe ſeynge they be called diſciples, they are not ſo ignoraunte, that they ſhoulde not at all knowe God and Ieſus Chriſte: as it were a ſimple chriſtian of the commune peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: but they lacked thys thynge, that they had not receyued the viſible graces, whyche God then ſhedde forth vpon his ſeruauntes.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſame were conferred vnto theym by the impoſition of ſaynte Paules handes. For it is no newe thynge, that the name of baptiſme ſhoulde be taken in ſuche ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacion: as we haue an example, where it is ſayed, that the Apoſtles called to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the wordes of our Sauioure, that Iohn dyd baptyſe in water: but that he, would baptyſe wyth the ſpirit. It is alſo an accuſtomed vſe of the ſcripture, to expound one word or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence by an other. It is ſayed then that ſaint Paul did baptiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the name of Chriſt, and then to expound what is ment therby, it is added: that he put his hands on them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that the holy Goſte diſcended on them. It is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but one only thing expreſſed tws waies, accordynge vnto the vſe of the ſcripture, as w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Notwythſtandinge let vs graunt them their aſkynge to ſe what they wyll or can inferre vpon it. Truelye they can ſaye none other thynge, but that ſaynct Paule baptiſed theſe diſciples, becauſe of their ignoraunce. Nowe if baptime ought to be reiterat for this cauſe, whye war not the Apoſtles rebaptiſed which three yeres after their baptyme, had ſo many errours, and folyſhe opinions, as to thyncke that the kyngedome of Ieſus Chriſte was earthlye, and vnderſtode nothynge touchyng his death and paſſion, and manye other ſuch lyke? Truely ſuche rudnes woulde well haue required a ſeconde baptyme, if an ignorante ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to be rebaptyſed. And as touchyng vs, we had nede alwayes to haue a lake or riuer at our backes, if it ſhould be nedeful for vs to be rebaptiſed as often as oure lord doth pourge vs of any errour that was in vs. On the other ſyde, it is ſayed, that Sainct Paule dyd baptiſe thoſe men, of whome we nowe ſpeake, before he layed hys handes on them Whiche were a verye ſhreude order, if that thynge be true, whiche theſe poore phantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calles do ſaye. For accordyng to their phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, the holye Goſt oughte fyrſte to be geuen to hys diſciples: and than conſequentlye the ſigne. But what nede is it to diſpute more herof, ſeynge we haue the thynge ſo clere? ¶ Be ſydes this, they haue nothynge to ſay agaynſt the baptim of infantes, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their is no wher any me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion made y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Apoſtles did vſe it. To this I anſwere, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no more do we rede in anye place, that they did at anye tyme
<pb facs="tcp:11396:14"/> myniſter the ſuper of our lorde vnto any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Why than do they make greater difficul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie of the one, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the other? They dare not ſay y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> women be not met to receiue the ſupper of our lord. And yet we rede not, that at anye time, the Apoſtles dyd myniſter it vnto wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Wher nowe, ſhall we take certitude, of this matter? That ſhal we do in conſidering the inſtitution, the nature, and ſubſtaunce of the ſacramente. For in ſo doynge, we ſhall ſe that it is as conuenient for them as for men. Nowe haue we ſhewed the lyke of baptyme: that is, that it is conueniente and doeth aper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayne vnto younge childrene: for as muche as our Lorde taketh them into the felouſhyp of hys churche. What do we axe more? It is ſuperfluous to inquiere of the cuſtome, wher the ryght is verye manyfeſt &amp; cleare.

Herein nowe lyeth the ſtryfe: that they thynke that in euery place, wher thys policie is not in his eſtate, or that it be not duely exerciſed, there is no church: &amp; that it is not lawefull for a chriſtian manne there to receyue the ſupper. Therfore do they ſeperate them ſelues from thoſe churches, in the whiche, the doctryne of God is purelye preached, takyng thys coloure, that they wil not be partakers of that polution, whiche is done there: bycauſe thoſe whych haue deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, are not baniſhed.</p>
                  <p>We on the otherſyde do confeſſe, that it is an imperfection, &amp; ſhreude ſpote in the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, when thys order is not there.

For I do gladlye ſubiecte my ſelfe to thys co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicion, that nothynge be beleued of that I ſhal ſay, excepte it haue the teſtimonye of the ſcripture. Nowe the fyrſte queſtion is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that companye, whych hath not ſuche an vſe of excommunication, as the Lorde Ieſus ordeyned, oughte to be taken for a Chriſten churche? Truelye thys defaute was at Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inthe, that ſame tyme that Sayncte Paulle wrote vnto them, as he declareth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth ther of.</p>
                  <p>¶ Thys notwythſtandynge, he gyueth them this honoure, that he calleth their congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, the chriſten churche. Ther was among them dyuers ſectes and parttakynges: ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion and avarice, raygned a monge manye of them. They wente ſo to lawe, as one woulde eate another. An offence, whyche among hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then men was execrable, was not onely tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate amonge them: but in maner approuyd. And beſydes ſuche a corruption in maners, there were alſo manye faultes in doctryne. Not wythſtandynge all thys, ſayncte Paulle ſpekyng not of hym ſelfe, but as the mouthe and organe of the holye Goſte, intituleth hys Epyſtle vnto the Chriſten churche whiche is at Corinthe. Who is that nowe amonge vs whyche wyll take vpon hym, to be more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in iudgemente, than god? who ſoeuer dare do it, ſhall ſhewe hys foliſhe boldenes:
<pb facs="tcp:11396:16"/> but he ſhall chaunge nothynge of that whiche God hath onſe pronounced. What ſhall we ſay of the Galathiens? We knowe the confu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſion and diſorder whiche was amonge them. But that notwythſtandyng Sayncte Paule knoweledgeth a church to be ther. We muſte erneſtely indeuoure our ſelues, to come vnto that perfection, whiche ought to be in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye of Chriſte. Yet maye we not loke for any other ſtate or condition in the churche, than that, which hath be ſhewed vnto vs, by the in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fallible verity. Let vs not than abuſe our ſel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ues to imagin a, perfect church in this world ſeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our lord Ieſus hath ſhewed vnto vs: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe ſhalbe leke vnto a floore where on men threſh, in whiche the good corne is ſo myng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led wyth the chaffe, that manye tymes it ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not. Alſo that ſhe ſhalbe lyke vnto a net, wherin dyuers ſortes of fyſhes are gathered together. Theſe ſimilitudes do teche vs, that though we ought to deſier an excellent pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the church: and alſo do our indeuour y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo it maye be: yet ſhall we neuer ſe it ſo pure, but that there ſhall be manye filthyneſſes ther in.</p>
                  <p>☞ For where it is ſayde that the Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſus hath ſhedde hys bloud to clenſe her, that ſhe ſhould be wythout wrinkle or ſpote: doth not ſygnifye that in thys worlde ſhe ſhalbe cleane from all ſpottes. But rather ſhe bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and goeth forwarde in good worckes daye by day, ſtretchynge hyr ſelfe fourth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that ende, vnto whych ſhe ſhal not attayne in thys worlde.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11396:17"/>
                  <p>Furthermore, the church is ſpotted wyth vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, two waies. For ther is no membre of the ſame, ſo pure nor ſo perfite, whyche is not alwayes compaſſed &amp; inuironed wyth many imperfections. Therefore all faythfull men, as longe as they be conuerſaunte in thys worlde, haue alwayes ſome vncleannes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynynge in theyr fleſhe: as all holye ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doeth teſtifye: and principally. S. Paul in the ſeuenth to the Romayns. Touchinge thys fourme of vncleannes, though we had a church in the beſt gouernaunce that might be in thys world: yet could we neuer auoide thys, that we ſhould not haue nede to be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed dayly by oure Lorde, in forgeuynge vs our ſynnes thorow hys mercye. The ſeconde maner or waye whereby the churche is ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is by the wycked hypocrites whyche are alwayes amonge the ſtocke of the good, to infect y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their fylthines.

This po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution ought to be taken awaye by the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of excommunication: and to trauel di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentlye therin, that it maye be done in dede But there be many churches, whyche do not theyr indeuour to caſte out ſuche filthines. Other ther be, whiche do take greate paine and diligence, and yet do not come to ſuche perfection, but that ther do remaine alwaies a greate numbre of wyked men vnpuniſhed,
<pb facs="tcp:11396:17"/> and that bycauſe the malice of hypocrites is ſo hyd, or at the leaſte wiſe not ſo diſcouered: that ſentence maye be geuen againſte it.</p>
                  <p>Let vs for a concluſion take thys to be true, whyche our Lorde hath ſayed, that we muſte vnto the ende of the worlde ſuffer many euil herbes: leaſte whyle we go aboute to plucke them al vp, we deſtroye the good corne with al. What wyll we haue more? Our Lord to proue his, hath made his churche ſubiecte to thys miſerye, that ſhe ſhal be alwayes, myng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led wyth good and euyll. We muſte there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be content therwyth.</p>
                  <p>And to ſaye trouth, we haue good occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo to do. For we ought to beare thys ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure vnto the holy worde of God and hys Sacramentes: that where ſo euer we ſe thys worde preached, and that accordynge vnto the rule whych is geuen vnto vs, god is ther purely honoured wythout ſuperſtition: and the ſacramentes there miniſtred, we ought to conclude wythoute anye doubte that there is the churche. What ſhoulde it elſe be? Shall the wyckednes of hypocrites, or of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempners of God abolyſhe the dignitie and vertue of the worde of God and his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes? Now I confeſſe that the diſcipline is alſo of the ſubſtaunce of the churche: and that it ought to be eſtabliſhed in good ordre. And when good policie or order wanteth in any place: as if excommunication be not in vſe, that then the true fourme of the churche is diſfigured. Yet may we not therfore ſaye, that ſhe is wholy diſtroyed, and no building there, ſeynge that ſhe retayneth that doctrine
<pb facs="tcp:11396:18"/> vpon whyche the churche is founded.</p>
                  <p>I ſaye further, that if we ſhoulde hade none other conſiderations, then to eſteme the chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che by the men and theyr maners: we ſhoulde many tymes be deceyued, and caſt oute ſome company, not eſtemynge them for the church, bycauſe of theyr imperfection: whyche not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wythſtandynge be in verye dede the churche. For it myght ſo come to paſſe, that we ſhold do iniury to manye good &amp; holy perſonages, whiche amonge the wycked be vnknowen &amp; hid, as the good corne vnder the chaffe.

If a faythfull manne be poluted in companiynge wyth the wicked when he praieth, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the doctrine, and Sacramentes of oure Lorde: then were all the Prophetes poluted, and he capitaynes to leade vs all into perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thorowe theyr enſample. Lette vs come to our ſauioure Ieſus and hys Apoſtles. We knowe at the leaſte, what was the ſtate of Hieruſalem at hys tyme. Yet oure Lorde Ieſus woulde be circumciſed communelye wyth other people. Furthermore at the daye of purification, he was conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to be borne to the temple, to be preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted vnto God after the maner accuſtomed. If it be aledged that he was receiued bi the handes of a holy man that is to ſaye Simeon: I anſwere that all that was done there, was done in the name of the churche: whyche was fylled wyth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny filthyneſſes and abhominations If anye do reply and ſaye, that he was a yonge child and therfore that it was not his propre fact: I anſwere that he was ſo a childe in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man whyche he toke of vs: that there whilſe he was gouerned by hys diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence:

But beyng a perfect man, preached, and that more is, he exerciſed hys office, and folowed thys trace vnto his death. If it be an offence to God to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a congregation (oute of whyche all the wicked be not excluded) to pray to God, and to make proteſtation of our fayth, what ſhal Chriſte ſaye, and what exemple hathe he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs, in goynge vnto the remple of Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem with the ſcribes and Phariſeis, a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo wycked as they then were? I knowe wel that they wyl anſwere me here, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte dyd not go into the temple, but for that intente he woulde rebuke the vyces whyche at that tyme were there committed: and not to participate with them in theyr ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and other proteſtations of theyr fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. That thys ſolution is falſe, it is eaſy to ſhew.<note place="margin">Gala. iiii.</note> It is not for nought that ſaint Paule ſayeth, that he was ſubiect vnto the lawe (I meane alwais Ieſus Chriſt) to win from the ſeruitud of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, al thoſe which were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto it. Now meaneth he expreſly the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial lawe. Therfore when he came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Temple, and chyeflye on the ſolemne feaſtes: thoughe he came thyther to haue the better occaſion to aduaunce the Goſpel, and to correct the naughti vices of the preachers: that notwythſtandynge, he ſhewed him ſelfe an obſeruer of the lawe, in doing thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges whyche were commaunded, as to come
<pb facs="tcp:11396:20"/> vnto the temple to worſhyppe, and to do ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. Thys thynge he confirmeth by hys own mouthe, ſpeakynge to the Samaritane. For, ſpeakyng in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of al the Iewes, he ſayeth thus. We knowe what we worſhyp. You know not what you worſhyp. For ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation is from the Iewes.

The reaſon which he addeth, geueth yet a more ample confirma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of thys thynge. That is, that ſaluation is from the Iewes.

                  <p>And yet we reade not, that he dyd ſeparate hym ſelfe frome theyr companie, for feare to be polluted by theim.

In theſe wordes ther be .ii. Articles to be noted</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11396:21"/>
                  <p>The firſte is, that to eate vnworthylye the Lordes breade, is not to communicate wyth ſuch as be vnworthy: but it is, in not wel pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>paringe him ſelfe, in examininge whether he haue fayeth and repentaunce. The ſeconde is, that whan we ſhoulde receyue the ſupper, we oughte not to begin the examinacion of other: but euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to proue him ſelfe. And in dede, if we do conſider the thynge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryghte, they whiche haue ſo good leaſure to inquire of other men, moſte commonlye for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to thyncke of ther owne matter. Ther is a man yet a lyue, the whiche beyng infected wyth thys erroure, that he feared to receyue the ſupper wyth vs, becauſe of ſome men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes imperfections: dyd therefore depriue hym ſelf of the communion of the church. Al thys whyle he had two ſeruauntes in hys houſe, of a verye wycked &amp; ſlavnderous life. I beynge aduertiſed ther of, declared thys thynge vnto hym, as farforth as he woulde here me at that tyme, ſaynge that he ought to indeuoure hym ſelf to pourge his own houſe of the which he had charge, if he thought to be defiled wyth the faultes of them whiche were not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto his gouernau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thys, he perceyued his folye, and toke this as a chaſtiſment ſente of God, to mocke hys preſumption. And ſo he reconciled hym ſelfe as well vnto me, as vnto the churche, know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledgynge that the principall is, to thyncke of oure ſelues, and of oure howſhoulde: and after that, to haue reſpecte vnto other, not that we ſhould wythdrawe oure ſelues from
<pb facs="tcp:11396:21"/> the church in diſpite of them, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be not ſuch as they oughte to be but for to correcte, &amp; reduce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or elſe to cauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cluded: otherwiſe: to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend them vnto God, that it myght pleaſe hym to ſet an order in it. ☞ Here it maye be replied, that Sayncte Paulle in the ſame Epiſtle doeth ſharpelye reproue the Corinthians, becauſe that in their congregacion, vyces were not puniſhed by excommunicacion: and further, doeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byd to haue conuerſacion wyth whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, dronkardes diſceyuers, Idolaters, and ſuche lyke: To thys I anſwere, that it is a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore faulte, worthye reproffe in the churche, that ther is no correction for ſinnes. And I ſaye further that the lorde doeth punyſhe the whole people, for thys onely fault. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let no churche, whych lacketh thys diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of excommunication flatter it ſelfe: as thoughe it were a ſmalle or lyghte faute, not to vſe it whan nede is: but rather let euerye man endeuoure as muche as in hym is, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe and brynge it to hys eſtate. Lykewyſe let euerye priuate man, helpe al that he maye, that it maye be done. But it cannot be, that euerye perticuler manne ſhoulde haue iuſte cauſe, to altenate hym ſelfe from the church, as oftentymes as thynges do not go after hys deſyer, For thys muſte be obſerued, that thys policie is not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of one me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, but oughte to exerciſe it ſelfe, by the conſente of the wholle bodye. Therefore Sayncte Paulle ſpeketh not ſpecialtye to eche one, to impute vnto hym thys faute: but doeth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<pb facs="tcp:11396:22"/> it to the hole bodye. The ſome of thys is, that touchynge the communion of the churche, we oughte to do our indeuoure, that all membres rotten or infected wyth conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious maladie: that is to ſay, all thoſe which lyue a ſlaunderous lyfe ſhould bekut of. But let vs conſider what is in vs, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue done y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which was our dudie &amp; office if we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not obtayne that thynge whiche we deſire to brynge to paſſe, let vs than commit the reſte to God, and praye that it maye pleaſe hym to put to hys hande, as it is hys worcke In the meane whyle, thoughe, by good ryghte, we haue cauſe to be ſorye, that we cannot ſe the churche of God in hys perfecte order: yet let vs beare that imperfection whiche is not in vs to correcte. Touchyng that ſaynct Paul forbyddeth to eate and drincke wyth ſuche as lyue a ſlaunderouſe life: that meaneth he of priuate conuerſacion and not of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke communion. But here wyll ſome man anſwere, if it be not lawefull for a chriſten man, to companye wyth a wycked man, to eate and drincke wyth hym for bodilye refec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: howe muche leſſe is it permitted him, to eate the Lordes breade in hys companye. To thys I anſwere, that it is in oure power and libertye, to vſe companye and haue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie priuatly w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the wycked. We muſte therefore euerye man in hys owne ſelfe, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayne from ſuche companye. But to receyue the ſupper of the lorde, is not a thyng that is in oure diſpoſition. And therefore the reſon, is dyuers. Let vs therefore note thys, that if
<pb facs="tcp:11396:22"/> the church do tollerate and ſuffer an vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye man: he that knoweth hym to be ſuche a one, doeth well to abſtayne from hys com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany priuatly, &amp; he ought to do it as muche as he may, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he make no ſchiſme or ſeparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the church touchyng the publyke comunio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. ☞ Touchynge the matter of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their is as much ſayde as the matter doth require: ſaue that I woulde aduertis, by the waye, all louers of the veritye, of one poynte whiche is in the article aboue ſayd, of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſtes, that by that they maye ſe what credite is to be geuen them in the reſt. That is where they ſay, that a man which hath by frailtie, without deliberat malice offendyd, after he hath bene twice ſecretelye warned, ought to be openly chaſtiſed, or excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. I forgeue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one errour in this ſaynge which is our lord would not that the church ſhould precede vnto exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſinner hath conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned to ſecret admonitions: but wyl y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he be warned ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly thre times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be caſte out. They are alſo, once more diſceyued, in that they conſider not that the lorde in that place ſpeketh not but of ſecrete ſynnes. For touching thoſe whiche are noto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rious and ſlaunderous amonge the people, ther is another waye and facion to procede wyth them, than to make declaration in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Lo here be two faultes which do wel de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clare what godlye doctours thes Anabapſtes be, and what ſpirite they haue to reforme, ſeynge they cannot ſpeake there wordes but to confounde all,</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11396:23"/>
                  <p>But yet I pardon them, al thys, that I may come to that poynte, whyche is of greater waight. For in ſaiyng that he which ſinneth by ignoraunce, and not by hys owne wyll, ought to be caſte out, they do declare, as they do openlye teache and mayntayne, that if a man do ſynne wyllyngely, he ſhall neuer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne forgeuenes of hys ſynne bycauſe, that all voluntarye ſynnes, after theyr phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſye, are ſynne agaynſte the holye Gooſte, and irremiſſible. I ſaye that thys opinion is an execrable blaſphemy agaynſt the grace of God, and a falſe doctrine verye pernitiouſe to dryue all poore ſoules to diſpayre. As I haue ſene the experience in ſome, which were for a tyme ſeduced to thys wycked ſecte. It is true, that we ought earneſtlye to thinke in oure ſelues, &amp; declare the ſame to other, that it is no ſmall thynge, wyllyngely to offende God, and to commit any acte agaynſte oure conſcience, to prouoke his wrath againſt vs. Therfore who ſo euer ſhall vſe theſe termes that if it ſo happen that after we haue kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen God, we do ſynne agaynſte our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is but a ſmall faulte eaſy to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned: and that God is not ſo greatly grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued therwyth, that we nede to torment oure ſelues therfore: we muſt auoyde ſuche a man as we woulde the Deuyll, whyche by ſuche flatteries woulde induce vs to the contempt of God: but let vs rather thynke thys, that it is no ſmall faulte to go agaynſte the holye wyll of God, by rebellion and contumacye, by aduiſed purpoſe violatynge hys Iuſtyce: and ſo to do, is outragiouſlye to violate the
<pb facs="tcp:11396:23"/> grace whyche he hath ſhewed vnto vs. Yea and it is muche to be feared that he whyche ſo mocketh wyth God, be not geuen ouer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a reprobate mynde, to be hardened in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyce, ſo that he ſhall neuer be conuerted. And here let vs brynge forth the threates, which in holy ſcripture, are made agaynſte ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude. But when all thys is ſayed and done, yet maye we not dryue theym into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre, whyche by chaunce haue thus fallen. For where ſhal we then be become? Amonge ten, hardelye ſhall we fynde one, that after he knewe God, hath not ſynned wyllyngly. Is not this to bring the holy church in to ruine: to brynge all men into diſpayre? They wyll ſaye, that thys bryngeth conſciences a ſlepe, to drawe them to do euyll. But I ſaye ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is a ſlepe whyche bryngeth hym ſelfe in beleife, that he neuer offendeth but by ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce: and that he maketh hym ſelfe ſo pure and innocente, that he neuer hath euyll wyll or euyll purpoſe. Let vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider. I pray you, how many waies the deuyl doth tempte vs. Who is he that is ſo vertuous, whyche doeth not ſometyme declyne? thoughe he be warned of God, and haue the teſtimonye of hys conſcience, to drawe hym in to the ryght waye. They aledge that al ſynne agaynſt the holye Gooſte is vnforgeuable. I confeſſe the ſame. But it is verye muche to ſaye, that all voluntarye ſynne, is agaynſte the holy Goſt. For he reſiſteth the holy Goſte, whyche ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:11396:24"/> can, to ouerthrowe it. Now a man may ſyn wyllyngly, and yet be not in wyl to warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt God, or to blaſpheme his holy word.</p>
                  <p>But we ſhal haue a ſhorte ſolution of this queſtion, if we do remit the diſcreſion therof vnto God, that is to ſaye, if we agre to that whiche he hath pronounced, as reaſon wold we ſhoulde, for ſeynge that to hym onelye is reſerued the authoritie to pardon ſynnes, it pertayneth to hym alſo to determine whiche ſynnes are remiſſible, and whyche not. Now fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt beginning he hath ordeyned amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the people of Iſrael that there ſhould be two kyndes of daylye ſacrifices. The one, for vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarye ſynnes, the other, for thoſe whyche were done by ignoraunce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> adding a promiſe to forgeue the one as well as the other. What wyll theſe poore phantaſticals ſaye vnto thys? The Lorde hathe ſayed that he wyll forgeue the voluntarye ſynnes of the fayethfull (for the ſacrifices were done for thoſe whyche were alreadye membres of the churche) and theſe men wyll bynde the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of God, and wythſtande hym, that he ſhall ſhewe no ſuch mercy if they reply, that thys thyng was done in the olde law, &amp; that the reſon is otherwiſe in our time thys caue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lation is to foliſhe. For we knowe that the infinite goodnes of God is not reſtrayned by the comminge of the Lorde Ieſus: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inlarged. More ouer we knowe that the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſacrifices were but figures of thoſe thynges whyche ſhould be fulfilled in Chriſt Ieſus. Seynge nowe that remiſſion of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarye
<pb facs="tcp:11396:24"/> ſynnes, is repreſented in the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente ſacrifices, and is promyſed to be done vnto them that are of the houſhold of faith: It is a playne and euidente teſtimonye, that the fayethfull obtayne, by the meanes of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, remiſſion not onely of their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunces, but alſo of theyr offences whyche they haue done willyngly. And to ſay troth, we haue ſo mani exemples, that it is a ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe boldenes for any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bryng the thing in doubte. If we take the olde teſtament: the Patriarkes when they conſpired their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death, were not ignoraunt that it was euil done. Ruben did not defile his fathers bedde thorow ſimplicitie. Iuda knew well, that whordome was a thynge diſpleaſaunte to God: &amp; yet he did not forſake the doyng of it. Dauid which daily puniſhed his ſubiects for euyl doyng, could not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit the adultery which he did, by ſimple ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. The mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy whyche God ſhewed vnto all theſe, is it ſpente or dead, that he can not as well ſhewe it nowe a dayes. But what nede haue we to borrowe exemples oute of the olde Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente, ſeynge we haue ſo many in the newe? Saynte Peter before he denyed the Lorde Ieſus, did he not hear this ſentence? He that denieth me before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, him wil I deny before my father. Therfor he could not prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And yet the Lord Ieſu ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed him mercy. S Paul co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaineth of certen me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which liued diſorderly in Theſſalonica: &amp; yet he hath good hope of theyir ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei be corrected &amp; brought to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

                  <p>Therfore the dutye of euery one of vs is to ſuffer pacientelye if any wronge be done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, rather then to vſe force and violence.</p>

                  <p>Beholde the ſpirite of God, whiche doeth pronounce by S.

                  <p>More ouer it is very euidente, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente of theſe poore phantaſticals is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempe all munitions, fortreſſes, engynes of warre, and ſuch lyke, whych are done for the defence of the countrye: and for bydde ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes to obeye theyr prynces and ſuperiours when they woulde haue theyr helpe in ſuche neceſſitye.</p>

                  <p>Nowe it is not founde in all the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that euer he forbode princes, by force of armoure to maintaine theyr contrye, againſt ſuche as agaynſte ryghte, vexed theym. It is very true that the Prophetes, ſpeakynge of the kyngedome of Ieſus Chriſt, do ſay that the ſwerdes and ſpeares, ſhall be turned into inſtrumentes of huſbandry, to tyle the earth.</p>
                  <p>But by ſuche maner of ſpeaches they do ſignifye none other thynge,<note place="margin">Eſa. ii.</note> but that al war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re and enmitye, ſhal ceaſe and be taken from the fayethfull.

                  <p>But ſeynge that fayeth and the loue of God haue not ſuche rule in the mooſte parte of menne, but that ambition and couetuouſnes
<pb facs="tcp:11396:27"/> haue often tymes the vpper hande: when one vniuſtly inuadeth an others contrye, and by warres doeth moleſte it: ſo farre is it of, that the prynce whyche is ordeyned of God, for the protection and defence of the ſame, doeth euyll in reſiſtyng the iniuſte violence, that he is bounde by the duty of hys office to do the ſame. It is true that a chriſtian prince ought to ſearche all meanes for peace, and to bye it dere wyth loſſes of hys owne: and ſo to do that it come not to the ſwerd, vntyll he haue aſſayed al remedies to auoyde thys neceſſitie But when he hath done al that it hym lyeth, and hath reculed as muche as he myght, if he can not otherwyſe mayntayne the countrye whyche is committed vnto him: the laſte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge is to vſe the ſwerde whyche God hathe put into hys hande. For it is all one reaſon, to pull out the ſwerde to puniſhe euyll doers whych trouble the publyke order, &amp; to thruſte backe thoſe whyche vniuſtelye come into a countrye and breake peace. In thys caſe, if a chriſten man, after the order of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye, be called to ſerue hys prince, doeth not only not offende God in goynge to the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, but is in a holye vocation, whiche can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reproued wythoute blaſphemynge of God. And in dede we ſe that when the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours came to Iohn Baptiſte to be inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of hym, he dyd not commaunde theym to caſt away theyr armoure and renounce their eſtate: but onelye dyd admonyſhe theim to be contente wyth theyr wages, and not to pole or vexe anye man, but to abſtayne frome all
<pb facs="tcp:11396:27"/> malice. Saynte Peter baptiſed Cornelius the Centurion: that is to ſay captayne of an hundred men: and yet he commaunded hym not to leaue hys companye and office as a thynge moſte wycked. And that more is, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge receyued the holye Goſte viſiblye, dyd neuertheles remayne ſtyll wyth the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, in hys office of the warres. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thys matter, if wee wyll kepe a good meane to reprehende that whych is euyl and viciouſe in warres, Lette vs not condemne ſimply the goynge to warre, when it is done by the authoritie of the prynce, for the defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the contrye: when the prynce hath none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpect but the commune profitte of his contry, and that the ſubiectes for their parte haue none other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration but to do their duty: but let vs reprehend the wycked deſires which are the cauſe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> raiſyng vp of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re: lette vs reprehende the cruelties, rapines, violences, extortions, and ſuche other inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies which are done there To mingle the good wyth the euyll, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne altogithers w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out diſcreſion, is a thyng without reaſon.</p>

To ſaye that it was a vicious imperfection in them, is to no porpoſe: ſeynge that the holye Goſte witneſſeth of the iudges, that God rayſed them vp to deliuer hys people: and thys ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularlye apereth in Moyſes, the which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge expreſſe commaundemente, woulde gladlye haue wythdrawen hym ſelfe, if he had coulde.

Now is thys verye true, touchynge ceremonies. But that we haue anye other rule to lyue by, touchynge the moreal lawe, as we cal it than had the aunciente people, is a faulſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

But wher is ther anye ſuche thinge ſpoken of the externe pollicie it is treue that the ſcepter and gouernaunce was taken from the ſtocke of Iuda, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the houſe of Dauid: but that there ſhould be no more gouernaunce, is manifeſtly agaynſt the holy ſcriptures.</p>
                  <p>☞ But to take a waye all ſcrupull in thys matter. We haue a very euident and expreſſe probacion, for where the prophetes ſpeke of the raygne of Ieſus Chriſte it is ſayde that kynges ſhall come and worſhip him, and do homage vnto him.</p>
                  <p>It is not ſayd that they ſhal depoſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there eſtate to become Chriſten wen but rather beynge conſtitute in riall dignitie they ſhalbe ſubiecte to Ieſus Chriſt, as vnto ther ſouerayne Lord.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11396:30"/>
                  <p>☞ Dauid folowynge this, in exhortynge them to do there deutie,<note place="margin">Pſal. 11.</note> doeth not commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d them to caſte awaye there diademes or ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: but onelye to kyſſe the ſonne: that is to ſaye to do hym hommage, and to be ſubiecte vnto hym, hauynge gouernaunce of other. He ſpeketh there of the kyngdome of oure ſauioure Ieſus Chriſte: and he doeth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhe al kynges and ſuperiours to be wyſe, &amp; to take good hede vnto them ſelues. What is thys wiſdom? What leſſon doeth he geue them? To geue ouer al? No: but to feare god and to geue honoure vnto his ſonne. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer: Eſaias propheſteth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the kynges ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be as fathers, nurces vnto the chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> church, &amp; that the quenes ſhal nurſſe them with there breſtes. I praye you howe agreth thys, that the kinges ſhalbe protectours of the chriſten churche, and yet there eſtate cannot ſtande with chriſtianitie? If the lord geue vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo muche place amonge hys people: as he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vnto the prophetes: we haue ſufficiente to proue oure intencion. Seyng that he doth apoynte vnto them, ſo honorable a place in the feloweſhyppe of hys people, that he geueth them thys honoure, I ſaye, as to ordeyne them protectours of hys churche: what impudencie is it to exclude them out of all? We conclude therefore, that princes ſeruynge God, maye well be Chriſten men: for as muche as the Lorde gyueth them ſuche a preheminence in the Chriſten rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11396:31"/>
                  <p>And in dede, it were a very folyſhe thynge that God ſhould ſo exalte and magnify ſuch a vocation, if it letted a manne to be the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunte of God. Saynte Paule exhorteth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery chriſtian man to perſiſte in that vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the whyche he was called. All ſhepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardes and labourers of the earth, all han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye craftes and ſuche lyke oughte to thynke theyr eſtate, holy, and that it hyndereth them nothynge, towchynge chriſtian perfection. Let vs ſe nowe, whyche eſtate is mooſte ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued of God, of one that keapeth beaſtes, or of one that gouerneth the people: whyche is not onelye approued: but alſo prayſed as worthye and excellente aboue all other.</p>
                  <p>I wyll ceaſe to rehearſe a greate meynye te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, whyche make well for the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thys matter, onely for breuites ſake. And alſo bycauſe one onely is ſuffitiente for vs. What greater prayſe wyll we haue of anye eſtate, then that by Gods owne mouth it be called diuine? If this title be geuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the eſtate of Prynces: who ſhall dare ſaye that it is vnmete for a fayethful man. Nowe it hath a more large prayſe. For the Lorde ſheweth thys fauoure to Prynces, as to call theym Goddes: and that not for theyr owne perſons ſake: but in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie wherein they are. The Lorde Ieſus ſheweth the reaſon why, that is bycauſe god hath committed and ordeyned ſuch a charge vnto theym. Me thynke that God canne not geue a more expreſſe teſtimonye, for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of anye eſtate, then when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth
<pb facs="tcp:11396:31"/> hys name vnto that man which is conſtitute in the ſame, as if he called hym hys Lieuetenaunt, whyche repreſenteth hys perſon. Wherefore I conclude, that who ſo euer deſpiſeth this vocation, ſo muche hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of God, doeth blaſpheme hys heauenlye maieſty. They wyl anſwer me, that to make it inferiour to the chriſtian perfection is not to diſprayſe it. But I replye, that they can not ſpeake wyth greater contumelye. For in ſayinge that it can not ſtande wyth chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, they do reiecte it as a prophane thynge. I paſſe not of theyr faire coloure, by whyche they couer theyr blaſphemye, in ſayinge that it is an ordinaunce of God. For the whole matter ſtandeth in thys, whether it be an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly office, which may be exerciſed by the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or whether a man whych commeth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, be thereby polluted. Nowe they do ſaye that who ſo euer doeth ſytte in the ſeate of iuſtice can not be reputed a chriſtian manne, bycauſe the office of a ſwerde hathe no place in Chriſtes churche.</p>
                  <p>Though ther were no more but that which ſaynte Paule ſayeth, there were inoughe to contente all ſuche as wyll agree to reaſon. He pronounceth that prynces are miniſters of God: and that the ſwerde is geuen theym by God, for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeruation of the good, and puneſhemente of the euyll. Vpon theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, theſe poore frenſye menne do make thys gloſe, that it is very true, that they be ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God, but yet that it is not lawefull for a fayethfull manne to take it on hym.
<pb facs="tcp:11396:32"/> Whyche is as one woulde ſaye: I confeſſe that thys worke is commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of God: but there is no man that can do it wyth a good conſcience, and alſo who ſo euer ſhall do it ſhall forſake God. I praye you is there anye man, that hath but oune once of brayne, that wyll ſpeake on thys maner? I woulde they ſhoulde anſwere me, in thys one thyng. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge they put no doubte, but that all handye craftes, whyche are ordeyned to ſerue vnto the commune vtilitie of mankynde, are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and holye, wherefore do they exclud out of thys numbre, the vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of prynces, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che doeth excell all the other? As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. They denye not but that a chriſtian man maye be a tayloure or a ſhoomaker. And yet theſe craftes haue no expreſſe wytnes in the ſcriptures. Wherfore the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do not they as wel permit a chriſtian manne to be a miniſter of Iuſtice, ſeynge that that eſtate hath ſo large approbation &amp; praiſe of the mouth of God? God doth pronounce that Prynces and all Superiours are hys miniſters, and that he hathe ordeyned theym to be defenders of the good and innocente, and to chaſtyce the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: and that in doinge thys, they do execute hys worcke, whych he hathe committed into theyr handes.</p>
                  <p>What Deuyll conſtrayneth theſe frenſye menne to make thys addition, that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Magiſtrates in ſeruynge God, are ſhutte oute frome the companye of Chriſten men? Whyche thing is not done to the hangeman for dogges, by theyr owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11396:32"/>
                  <p>I wyll aledge one place more and then an ende. Saynt Paule perceyuing in his tyme, that the moſt parte of the princes were mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall enemies of the Goſpell, &amp; that this thing myght ſtomake the faythfull, and cauſe them to beare no good affection towardes theym, doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund Timothe, that ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne praiers ſhoulde be made for theim in the churche: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge for a reaſon, that God would that all ſhould be ſaued, and come to the knowledge of the trueth. He meaneth not that God wyll brynge to ſaluation, and by conſequence, to the knowledge of his goſpell, all men of the earth, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fyrſt vnto the laſte: but he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth al eſtates: bicauſe it might appeare that this eſtate of princes, of which he ſpak, was as it were reiecte &amp; curſſed, for aſmuch as all dyd perſecute the goſpel. Whiche thing if it had bene true, it had bene ſuperfluous &amp; foly to pray for them. Lette vs now gather out of theſe wordes of the Apoſtle, that, which may playnely be gathered and ſeduced.</p>
                  <p>If god wil bring Princes vnto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of hys trueth: by what authoritye wyll the Anabaptyſtes thurſte theym oute? If any man wyll replye, that Prynces maye well be conuerted vnto God, but that muſte be in forſakynge their dignitie That ſaiyng is to to manifeſte agaynſte the mynde of Saynte Paule.</p>
                  <p>For ſaynte Paule ſayeth not, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſholde forſake theyr Principalities, for to become chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And alſo the wordes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he vſeth, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <pb facs="tcp:11396:33"/> in no wyſe ſtande wyth ſuche euaſion. For if it behoued a prynce to geue ouer hys dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitye, to become a chriſtian man, it ſhoulde folowe, that that eſtate ſhoulde be voyde of the grace of God, as vnlawfull &amp; reproued.</p>
                  <p>But they thynke ſurely, that they haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible obiections to excommunicate oute of the churche, and from all hope of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the eſtate of Prynces, in alledgynge certaine places euyll vnderſtanded, whych they wreſt ſhamfully to thys purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Fyrſte they aledge that the Lorde Ieſus, dyd not ordayne, that the womanne whyche was taken in adulterye, ſhoulde be ſtoned to death, as the lawe of God required: but that he vſed mercye towardes hyr, ſayinge. Go ſinne no more. Before I anſwere, I wyl are one queſtion of them. They ſaye that in the chriſtian church, excommunication doth ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the materiall ſwerde, in ſuche wiſe, that where as afore tyme a cryme was puniſhed by death, nowe the offender oughte to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by priuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the companye of the fayethfull. Therefore I aſke them how they wyll excuſe Ieſus Chriſte, for that which he hath done? For he hathe not obſerued theyr rule: neyther in condemnynge the woman to be baniſhed from the holy congregation: nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther yet to dye. By thys a man may ſe, howe brayneles they be, ſpeakynge wythoute rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Nowe do I come vnto the true ſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whyche is very eaſye. It is to be noted, that theſe poore beaſtes in thys place, folowe the expoſition, wherewyth the Papaſticall prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes
<pb facs="tcp:11396:33"/> haue made theyr ſtones fatte. For ſeyng maryage was forbydden them, for a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, they ſought to haue leaue, to playe the whoremongers, and ſo haue borowed theyr neyghbours wyues. And bycauſe adulterye ſhoulde not appeare to be ſo greate a ſynne, they ſayed that in thys matter, we be vnder the lawe of grace. And in a maner they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the grace of Ieſu Chriſt in none other thynge, but onelye in thys, that he lefte adulterers vnpuniſhed. Theſe poore people do folow them, and it happeneth vnto them, accordynge to the ſayinge of our Sauioure Ieſus Chriſte, that if one blynde leade an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blynde, boeth fall into the dytche. Now is it verye true that the Lorde Ieſus would in no poynte chaunge the policie or cyuyl or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: but wythout anye derogation therunto, woulde do hys office, for whyche he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the worlde: that is to ſaye, to pardon ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. For he was not ſent of God hys father to exerciſe the office of a worldelye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iudge: but to redeme the worlde by hys deathe, and to teſtifye the grace of thys redemption, by the preachynge of the Goſpell, and of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goodnes whyche we receyue by hym. As we ſe howe he promiſeth to receyue the thefe into Paradyce: and yet neuertheles doth ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffer hym to beare the payne of hys wycked dede. Therfore it is all one abſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which he maketh vnto the womanne, and vnto the thefe. But the worldly Iuſtice puniſheth the thefe: the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth depart vnpuniſhed by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Iudges were gon a way for ſhame.
<pb facs="tcp:11396:34"/> In ſomma, the act which our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt dyd to the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in adultery, is none other, but the ſame which his ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes and miniſters of his word, now adaies vnto al e<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uil doers. For they take paine only to exhort the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and to turne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the ryght waye, and after warde to conforte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in theyr conſciences, preſentynge vnto them the grace of oure Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, &amp; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurynge theym of the remiſſion of theyr ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes They do not take vpon them to puniſhe them. For that thynge doeth not appertayne vnto theym, but in the meane whyle they do not hinder Iuſtice, that it ſhoulde not be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred. The whole matter is, if we knew the offyce of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſholde we be out of all doubte in thys matter. Hys office is to forgeue ſynnes, and to bende hys worde ts the conſciences of ſynners To do corporall puniſhmentes, he doeth not meddle but leaueth that vnto them whych haue that authoritie, and vnto whom the charge is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: folowynge that whyche in an other place he ſayd. Geue to Ceſar y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whych is Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars. Out of the ſame ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce proceadeth the ſecond allegation whych they make.</p>
                  <p>Ieſus Chriſt ſay they, woulde not make perticio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betwene two brethren. Therefore it foloweth that a chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man ought not to intermeddle in Ciuill quarels, to be a Iudge.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11396:34"/>
                  <p>Fyrſte, Saynte Paule permitteth chriſtian men to do that whyche Ieſus Chriſt refuſed in thys place to do: that is frendelye to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde the differences, whyche ryſe amonge the fayethfull, for worldely goodes. For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had rebuked the Corinthians, for that they pleded before painim Iudges: and that by thys occaſion the name of God was blaſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phemed: he ſheweth vnto them howe muche better it were, that they ſhoulde ende theyr controuerſies by arbytrers, choſynge Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges amonge the faythful, to decide their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes. And further maketh thys argumente, that ſeynge we ſhall iudge the Aungelles, by a ſtronge reaſon we be able to iudge world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matters. If we after the exemple of Chriſt ought to refuſe all arbytterme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes and iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. S. Paul did euyl to induce vs vnto it.</p>
                  <p>Nowe is it certayne, that it is the holye Goſte, whyche ſpeaketh by hys mouth. We ſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, howe theſe dulheades blaſpheme God in that they wold co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne that thyng, whych he approueth. Moreouer if it be not lawfull for a chriſten man, to take vpon hym to ende quarelles that ryſe, touchyng poſſeſſions, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritages, and other goodes. I do axe of theſe good Doctours, what ſhall become of the worlde? For it is not poſſible that menne ſhal mayntayne contractes togythers: as the neceſſitie of manne requireth, but that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes ther wil ariſe doubtes, which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an arbitrer or a Iudge to decide them.</p>
                  <p>If they ſaye that, that thynge ſhall not happen amonge the Chriſtians. That is a falſe lie. Foraſmuch as betwene two men of
<pb facs="tcp:11396:35"/> good conſcience, by the infirmitie of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, may happen ſome ſtrife. As we be blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in our owne cauſe: ſo do we thynke eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to haue the ryghte. If a chriſtian man maye not meddle in theyr controuerſies, to ſet them at one, by arbittermente: what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion ſhall there be in the ende? By thys it is eaſy to perceyue, that theſe wycked fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticals, do pretende none other thinge, but to ſee all thynges out of ordre, to make al goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des commune, in ſuche wyſe, that who that can catche them ſhall be happy: though they deny it myghtely. But lette all Iudgementes and arbittermentes be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the world, accordynge to theyr intente, and accordynge as they ſtrayghtlye commaunde, what ſhall ther be then but an vnbrydeled theuerye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all? or elſe they do hope to perſwade all gouernours and miniſters of iuſtice to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake theyr places, that they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues might ſuccede into them as into a voide poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Why then, (wyl they ſaye) hathe the Lord Ieſus refuſed to do a good &amp; a holy worke? herke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his anſwer, &amp; this queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal be ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Who hath (ſayed he) made me a iudge, or a diuider betwene you? He ſayeth not that it is an vnlawefull thynge: but onelye he aledgeth that he is not ordeyned in that vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And in dede the offyce for whych he came into the world, ſhold haue bene darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if he had occupied hym ſelf in theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges. Wherfore if we wil take profit by theſe exemple, and folowe it. Lette vs folowe that rule whyche Sayrte Paule geueth vnto vs, that euerye manne take hede where in he is
<pb facs="tcp:11396:35"/> called. And for as muche as we be one body in the Lorde, that the arme do not vſurpe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the eye, neither yet the hand ouer the fot. And to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude in fewe words. I aſke whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pertition be a lawefull thynge amonge chriſtians: or that all thynges oughte to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſed. For if it be permitted to diuide heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages: he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> taketh the office vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to make the perticio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not worthy reprofe, if ſo be, he be therunto appoynted. Theſe enemyes of the cyuyl policie, make not another argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</p>
                  <p>Ieſus Chriſt, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>drew him ſelfe into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine, &amp; hid him felfe ther, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they wold haue made him king. It foloweth therfore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the eſtate of iuſtice, he ought by no meanes to accepte it: but to w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe him ſelfe after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exemple of hys maiſter.</p>
                  <p>¶ The anſwere. I am almoſte aſhamed to rehearſe ſuch vayne things. But for aſmuch as I do perceyue that the ſymple and rude are ſeduced by ſuche: I am co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe them, how they may auoyde them. Euery manne knoweth the folyſhe fantaſye which the Iewes had of Meſſias. That is, they thought that he ſhould haue his kynge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome floriſhing in this world, to make them liue in this worlde at theyr caſe, and in good
<pb facs="tcp:11396:36"/> reſt, and to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> triumphe. In ſo muche that the very Apoſtles, tyl after hys reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had alſo thys fantaſye in theyr heades: as. S. Luke declareth in the .i. of the Actes. This moued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people to make Chriſt a king perforce, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might therby be made fre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſubiection of the romayns. Therefore it is no wonder if the Lorde hid him ſelfe, for aſmuch as this proceaded from an euil and peruerſe errour, &amp; drew with it a very perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. It is certen that his kinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not carnal nor of the world: but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and whiche doeth conſiſte in thynges that do not appeare vpon the earth. Nowe what kyngdome would me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giue him? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he hadde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſented vnto the foly of the people, ſhoulde he not haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fyrmed that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure whiche was alreadye to muche roted? ſhoulde not he alſo by that meanes, haue bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his grace and his veritie, for as muche as men ſhoulde haue imagined nothynge of hym but carnal. Beſides this, he ſhould haue bene ordeined king, by ſeditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by whom it appertayneth not. For ſeynge that Iury was in ſubiection vnto the Romayne Empyre: the people had none authoritie to choſe a newe kynge at their pleaſure. Thus for theſe cauſes Ieſus Chriſte refuſed to be king, and not to reproue the eſtate as wicked or repugnaunte to a chriſten life. But in the meane while it is ſayede,<note place="margin">Prouer. vii.</note> that it is by hym that Kinges do raygne: that it is he whyche doth giue grace to the miniſters of iuſtice, to make lawes and ſtatutes, and to gouerne the people in equitie. What will we haue more Ieſus Chriſt is not a king in his perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but
<pb facs="tcp:11396:36"/> he is the protectour of al kingdoms, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he hath fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded &amp; inſtituted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But theſe fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The kinges of the natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s haue dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but it ſhal not be ſo amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g you I graunt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the office of the Apoſtles, &amp; of the worldely principalities, be not both one, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in their office is no dominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu Chriſt wold ther none other thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne betwen the one &amp; the other.

It is aſmuch as one wold ſay. It is not lawful for a king to do the office of a miniſter, vnto whiche he is not called: ergo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eſtate of a miniſter is an yl &amp; vnlawful thing.

Therefore theſe power phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticalles do euilly expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thys place, to ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in place y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of the ſwerd is forbobde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. ☞ To make vp a greate healpe of witne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſes, they do alſo alledge, that Sainct Paule doeth ſaye: that thoſe whiche God knewe be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore, he hath preordeyned to be made lyke vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the exemple of hys ſonne. I graunt vnto them, that folowynge the exhortacion which Saincte Paule maketh in that place, beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs to beare the mortification of Ieſus Chriſt in our bodyes, and indewer thoſe tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations and miſeries, by which God wyll trye vs. But doeth it folowe of this, that a fayethful man, maye not gouerne the people whiche are committed vnto hym? They ſaye ye, becauſe that Ieſus Chriſt dyd ſuffer, and not rule. As touchynge the fyrſte, that he dyd ſuffer, I ſaye ſo did Dauid: in whoſe perſon the paſſions and ſufferynges of hym were prefigured. And yet that notwythſtandynge, we cannot ſaye, that he dyd not gouerne. Therefore of ther owne hede they do ad this ſeconde parte, vnto the text of Sainct Peter miſcheuouſly falſefyeng it, to diſceiue the po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wer ſimple people. For in there boke they go aboute to perſwade, that Saynct Peter ſpeketh after that manner, whan it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge ſo. Behold nowe Dauid which was a Kynge, adminiſterynge the power of the
<pb facs="tcp:11396:37"/> ſwerde: and yet that hindered hym not to ſuffer, that he myghte be made lyke vnto the Image of Ieſus Chriſte, yea euen ſo muche, that he dyd repreſent hym. Saincte Phillip folowyng thys, whan he ſhoulde baptiſe the Eunuichus, whyche was one of the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of kyngdome of Ethiopia, dyd not laye vnto hym thys condicion, that he ſhould no more be a ruler: but onelye axid of hym, if he beleued wyth hys whole herte in Ieſus Chriſte: and ſo lefte hym in hys eſtate as he was. And truelye if to haue dominion be a thyng contraye to a Chriſten man: that ſame ſhoulde as well be true ouer one man, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a communaltie. Nowe is it true that S Paulle doeth permit Chriſten men, to haue ſuperioritie and dominion ouer ther ſeruaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes which in thoſe dayes were vnto them as bonde men and ſlaues: and doeth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde them to ſet them at libertie: but only to vſe them gentelye, and frendelye wyth hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie. Moreouer he ſuffered Philemon, whome he calleth hys companion, to kepe hys bondman, in hys authoritie onely he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth that he ſhoulde order hym gentelye. We ſe than, that thoughe it were expreſlye ſayd that Ieſus Chriſt did not gouern, how foliſhe a thynge it is thus to reſonne, Ieſus Chriſte hath ſuffered, and not ruled: therfore al dominion is reproued. For it is as muche as who woulde ſaye. That Ieſus Chriſte hadde not aplace to laye hys heade one, as hym ſelfe wytneſſeth: therefore it is euyll done whan a Chriſten man doeth poſſes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:11396:38"/> houſſe, or garden, or heritage. Howe much thys argumente goeth from reſon, eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry man ſeyeth.</p>
                  <p>☞ Laſt of al, lyke as a dronkerde, after he hath wel belched, doeth degorge the vyllaine broth whiche charged hys ſtomake: euen ſo theſe wycked men, after they haue detracted thys holye eſtate whiche the Lorde hath ſo muche honored, finallye wyth full throte, they do ſpewe out excedynge deformed blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies. The gouernaunce, ſaye they, of the Magiſtrates, is after the fleſhe: and that of Chriſten men, is after the ſpirite. Me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nowe, that I do here the paynted pope, blaſphemynge agaynſte holye mariage. For he vſeth theſe tearmes. But thys is nothyng, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to that whiche foloweth. The habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion of Magiſtrates, ſaye they, is perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in this world: but the habitacion of the Chriſtians is in heauen. And ſuch like. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeche you, by the name of God, all fayeth ful men, and I admoniſhe you, wel to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe thynges, whyche Sayncte Peter and Sayncte Iude, haue wrytten of certayn corrupters, whyche in their tyme peruerted the fayeth of the ſimple: and by ther wordes I praye you make compariſon wyth thoſe thynges whiche I wyl recite of the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes. In thys thinge I wyl ſay nothinge, but that, whiche euerye man ſhall perceiue to be true: that is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the one ſecte, differeth nothing from the other in this thynge. But becauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man hath not the bokes at hand I wyll here ſet the places together. The fyrſt ſayeth
<pb facs="tcp:11396:38"/> thus: they ſhalbe preſumtuous and ſtobborne diſprayſaynge them that are in authoritye, and they haue no ſham to blaſpheme agaynſt all dignitie, lyke vnto brute beaſtes, diſpray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynge thoſe thynges whiche they knowe not. And Sainct Iude ſayeth: they ſhal reiect the ſigneuries, and blaſpheme againſt the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes Nowe Michel the archangell, pledynge agaynſt the diuell for the bodye of Moyſes, durſt not geue raylinge ſentence againſt him but ſayd: the Lorde rebuke the Sathan. But theſe ſpeake euyll of thoſe thynges whyche they knowe not: and thoſe thynges whiche they knowe naturallye, as brute beaſtes, in thoſe thynges they do corrupte them ſelues: Theſe be the wordes of Apoſtles: whyche be ſo truelye verified vppon our Anabaptiſtes, that it myght well apere, that they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſelye ſpoken of them.</p>
                  <p>In that they ſaye, that the habitation of princes, is permanente in the worlde: howe often tymes doeth Dauyd proue them lyers, where he proteſteth that hys meditacion was holye, to tend and aſpire vnto ſpiritual lyfe?

                  <p>I wyl therefore, laye before the Anabapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, Moyſes, Dauid, Ezechias, Ioſias, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, Daniell, all the kynges and Iudges of Iſraell, to ſe howe they can mayntaine their cauſe: to know whether they were banyſhed the kingdome of god bicauſe thei had the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the ſwerd in thys world. In that they ſay: be that al prynces cares of this world, E<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſaias reproueth theym, where he promiſeth that the earthly kynges ſhall ſerue to mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne the heauenly and ſpiritual kyngdome of Chriſte. Euen ſo ſaynte Paule, in exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge that prayers ſhoulde be made, for all ſuch as be in eſtate of preheminence, that we may lyue a peaceable lyfe vnder them, in the feare of God, and holye lyfe: doeth declare that the pryncypall ende of Magiſtrates is not to kepe theyr ſubiectes in peace after the fleſhe: but rather to procure that God be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and honoured in theyr contrye, and that euery man leade a good and honeſt lyfe.</p>
                  <p>Therfore in thys poynte, we ſe howe falſe and peruerſe the allegations of the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtes be, to condempne the vocation of the Magiſtrates, whyche God hath ſo well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued. Furthermore we ſe howe the deuyl ſpeaketh by theyr mouthes, to thend to turne awaye the Prynces, and to hynder them to do theyr dutye. For in ſtede to exhorte theym to indeuer theym ſelues and take payne that the name of God myght be exalted, and that he myghte raygne ouer theym, in ſuche wyſe that they ſhall be but as hys veſſels and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers: come theſe and woulde make theym be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue

                  <p>At the fyrſte ſhewe it appeareth that there is no euyll in thys Article. We ſe at this day the worlde ſore geuen to othes, there is no good herte, whyche is not greaued to ſe the name of God thus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temned: by whych it is brought to paſſe that euerye othe, what ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it be, is become odious. More ouer ther is a certayne apparaunce, in theſe wordes of our ſauioure Ieſus, whyche they do alledge that all othes in general are forbydden, and it appeareth true, if a man do not take good hede vnto the cenſes. But touching the firſte parte, it is true that ſuch an enorme and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayſe worthye diſſolution and licence, as is nowe adayes in the worlde, in the matter of othes, ought excedyngely to diſpleaſe vs. And it were muche better, not to ſwere at all then ſo vaynelye to ſwere for euerye cauſe, or rather wythoute cauſe. Notwithſtandynge we muſt note this, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane to reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; correct an abuſe, is not to mingle &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it with the good vſe, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly the one and the other togither.

Aſmuch or more is it of an othe. The Lorde hath ordeyned it to confirme and ratifie the truth, when there is nede thereof. Suche a maner of ſwerynge turneth is hys honour double. Bycauſe that by that meanes charitie is continued among men, and the trueth, whyche he hathe in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler recommendation, is maintened: &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it is done for the only teſtimonie of the trueth, in doynge therof men gyue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym one of the pryncipall honours why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che he requireth. And in dede, it is expreſſed in the lawe, that a true and lawful othe, is a kind of honour whiche is done vnto hym by his people. For euen as he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth that we ſhold inuocate &amp; cal on him onelye, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth that we ſhould ſweare by his name. And the prophetes cryinge our againſt Idolatrye, make often mention, that menne haue ſworne by ſtraunge Goddes: contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye wyſe, wyllynge to ſignifye that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyce of God ſhoulde whollye be reſtored, they ſaye that menne ſhall ſweare by hys</p>
                  <p>Thys is then the ryghte waye to treate of othes. Fyrſte of all, we muſte ſhewe that the vſe therof is double, that is, to geue teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye of thynges paſt and already done, and to bynde oure ſelues to do in tyme to come that whyche maye lawefullye be required of vs.</p>
                  <p>After thys, we muſte ſhewe, that to ſwere is to call God vnto wytneſſe: and therefore it behoueth vs herein to ſhew what reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
<pb facs="tcp:11396:41"/> we beare vnto his name. Of this it foloweth that a manne ſhoulde neuer open hys mouth to ſwere but wyth feare of God, in ſinguler honour and humilitie. Thus by thys meanes all theſe formes of blaſphes, wher the name of God and of Ieſus Chriſte is contumeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſtre taken, ſhall be ryght well reproued. Moreouer it muſte be ſhewed, by howe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye waies the name of God is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in vaine and fyrſte of al, deteſte al periuries and falſe atteſtations, as excreable blaſphemies: for as muche as the veritye of God, thereby is tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into leaſinge: for as much as all hys glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye thereby is ouer throwen, and therby me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> woulde as it were compell hym to deny hym ſelfe. Conſequently it muſte be ſhewed what a contemnitie of God it is, to take hys ſacret name in daliau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as by pleaſure, or to decke oure language, or for a ſuperfluouſe fyllynge vp of oure ſpeache, or by anger, or by laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and myrthe: and ſo muche more ſharpelye rebuke thys vyce, as we ſee it nowe a dayes roted faſte in the worlde, &amp; that the cuſtome therof is ſo commune: on the other ſyde, wee muſte rebuke theſe ſuperſtitions by whyche the name of God is polluted, as when men do indifferentelye take the names of ſayntes and myngle them wyth it. After thys ſorte, an othe doeth not onely importe, no propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the name of God: but doth greatly make for hys honoure. Now when the ende is ſuche: who ſhall dare ſay that it is a vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſe and a wicked thyng? The ſume is that the worlde be warned that God hathe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge
<pb facs="tcp:11396:41"/> in greater recommendation then the glory of hys name to mayntayne it thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, and to punyſhe thoſe whyche do obſcure or leſſen it, Therefore no man ought to take hys name but in greate reuerence, onelye to make it ſerue vnto ſuch ende that he may be glorified thereby.</p>
                  <p>But the Anabaptiſtes lyke mad bedlems, do condemne all othes wythoute exception: wythoute decernynge whether there be good or euyll in it. And by thys it appeareth, that theyr ſayinge is nothynge grounded on rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Let vs nowe come vnto authoritie, to ſe whether they haue anye teſtimonie of the worde of God. They do make a great buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of theſe wordes of oure Sauioure Ieſus Chriſte, where he forbiddeth vtterly to ſwere for out of that they do conclude, that neither for ryght nor wronge it is lawfull to ſwere. For anſwere, I do fyrſt aſke them, whether thei thinke that Ieſus Chriſt would ad any thynge vnto the lawe of God hys father, or whether he woulde ſimplye interprete the lawe? If they do ſaye as touchyng that, that he hathe declared the perfection of the lawe: Then aſke I further, whether this perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was neuer knowen by fore? If they ſaye no: I ſaye that it is an euident lye. Moyſes after he hadde publiſhed the lawe, doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt vnto the people, that he hathe ſhewed the waye of lyfe, and the waye of death.</p>
                  <p>☞ Moreouer reducynge altogyther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into a ſhorte ſummarye, he ſayeth that hys doctryne doeth tende vnto thys ende, that a
<pb facs="tcp:11396:42"/> manne ſhould loue God wyth all hys herte, wyth all hys vnderſtandynge, wyth all hys ſoule and ſtrengthe. Alſo in an other place: And now Iſraell, what is that whych God requireth of the, but onelye that thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſte cleaue vnto hym wyth thy whole hert? Theſe ſentences do ſufficientlye proue that the doctrine of the lawe doeth contayne a rule of well lyuynge, to leade a manne to an whole perfection. It is therfor very certaine that God hath in the law, declared his good wyll. He hath I ſaye, once for all pronunced of good and euyl, touchinge thoſe thynges whyche are pleaſing or diſpleaſinge to hym. Therefore the Lord Ieſus, alwayes whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſpake of the perfite life,<note place="margin">Mathew .xx.</note> did ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thoſe that he taught thither. And S Paule in the twelfthe of the Romayns doth lead vs vnto the ſame ende, that we might the better perceiue what is our dutye. Therefore to ſaye that Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes dyd but halfe teache the people of Iſrael to honoure and ſerue God: is a blaſphemye, firſt forged by the Papiſtes, and now renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe pore phantaſticals, whyche take for a reuelation frome heauen, what ſo euer fabils they haue heard of their gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dmothers</p>
                  <p>If anye do here replye agaynſte thys that Ieſus Chriſte is called the perfection of the lawe, and that it is ſayd that we be no more gouerned by childyſh doctrine, as the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente people were. I anſwere, that this word perfection is not mente of the doctrine: but is referred vnto the grace of the holy ſpirite, by whyche, that whyche is contayned in the
<pb facs="tcp:11396:42"/> lawe, is written and imprynted in oure her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, to the ende that the Lorde ſhoulde not onely ſpeake to our eares, but alſo vnto our wyll: and that we ſhoulde not onelye heare thoſe thynges whyche he doeth commaunde vs but that we ſhoulde do them.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo a ſeconde reaſon, whyche is that the Lorde Ieſus him ſelfe alone hath in hys owne perſon accompliſhed al Iuſtice, &amp; was a perfecte obſeruer of the law, that hys obedience whyche he gaue vnto hys father, myght be imputed vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>Touchynge that, ſaynte Paule calleth the lawe childyſhe doctrine: that meaneth he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye of the ceremonies and figures. And in a lyke ſence he ſaieth that the lawe coulde not brynge hyr Diſciples to perfection. For as muche as the ende, the accompliſhmente and veritie thereof, is in Ieſus Chriſte. In the reſte, as pertaynynge to the doctrine of lyfe, ſuche as it was in the begynnynge, ſuche is it euen nowe at thys preſent, alike to vs and to the chyldren of Iſraell. For it varieth not but as the wyll and iuſtice of God is immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, euen ſo the lawe whyche is a true and certaine declaration thereof, doeth remaine vnto the laſte ende, ſuche as it was at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, If it be graunted touchinge ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng, Ieſus Chriſt hath ſimplye interpreted the commaunddement of God his father, and hath added nothinge thereunto: as we muſte neades confeſſe: then haue we won y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whych we requyre. For the lawe forbiddeth not to take the name of God in no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth
<pb facs="tcp:11396:43"/> to take hys name in vayne: ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther is a lawful way to take &amp; vſe his name the whyche he hathe alſo permitted.</p>
                  <p>Notwythſtandynge it is neceſſarye that we expounde the wordes of our ſauiour Ieſus, bycauſe that at the fyrſte ſyght, it appeareth that he woulde forbydde all othes Nowe to haue good and perfecte vnderſtandyng, it behoueth to knowe the occation whych mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued hym thus to ſpeake. The Scribes and Phariſeis as it appeareth thorowe oute the fyfte chapter of ſaycnte Mathewe, hadde by theyr faulſe gloſes ſo corrupted the people, that menne made no conſcience to do manye thynges agaynſte the commaundementes of God: ſo that they coulde make any excuſe or coloure to couer them ſelues. So comunelye they thought it not euyll done, to ſweare in vayne and folyſhly by heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earthe ſo that they dyd not directlye ſweare by the name of God.</p>
                  <p>Nowe the Lorde Ieſus ſheweth that it is a folyſhe cauillation and ſophiſtry, to thinke ſo to purge them ſelues before God: ſeynge that vnder heauen and earth his name is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly compryſed. So when he forbyddeth to ſwere at all, thys worde, at all, is referred vnto the maner of ſpeache, or to the wordes whyche men vſe, whyche maye be proued by that he addeth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently, nother by heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for it is the throne of God: nor by the earth: for it is hys fote ſtole. Nowe the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtes do peruerſlye applye thys to the motif, or to the cauſe: as thoughe it were forbyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb facs="tcp:11396:43"/> to ſwere for anye cauſe that myghte be, whyche is contrary to the minde of the Lord and contrarye to the ſence whyche hym ſelfe doeth gyue, in the proceſſe and deduction of hys wordes.</p>
                  <p>In the meane whyle they would make vs beleue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we do gloſe thys place, as thoughe we ſhoulde haue ſayed, that it is euyll done to ſweare, or by the earthe: but to ſweare by God it is permitted. Or at leaſte wyſe, they do lay this vnto our charges before the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Idiotes, whyche haue nothynge hearde or ſene of vs to Iudge by. And then hauyng caſte oute thys faulſe reporte of vs, they crye out ſaiynge. Oh blynde foles whiche do not perceiue that God is greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hys throne. To whom do they ſpeake thys, but to them ſelues? ſeynge that they &amp; no body elſe, haue forged thys in theyr fantaſticall braynes, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it foloweth in the wordes of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Ieſus Chriſt, that no man ſhal ſweare by hys heade: bycauſe no man can make one heere whyte or blake. Beholde ſaye they, the cauſe why all othes be forbydden: is for that we canne not performe that whiche we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. But I ſaye contrarye, that if Beaſtes could ſpeake, they would ſpeake more wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye. Fyrſte, there is a manifeſt contradiction in that whiche they babble.</p>
                  <p>For thys reaſon is ſpeciall for all othes, where wee promiſe to do a thynge to come. Therfore it foloweth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that oth, by whiche I teſtifie of a thynge whych is already done is not euyll. Doeth it not appeare I praye
<pb facs="tcp:11396:44"/> you, that they are altogyther wythoute wit, to reaſon thus? we canne not performe that whyche we promiſe, therefore all othes are forbidden. The replication to this is eaſye, that there is one kind of othe, in whych ther is no queſtion to be bounde to do any thing: but onely to wytnes the truth, of a dede paſt. Alſo that it is the moſt vſed othe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly the ſence is farre otherwiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they do imagyn. For the Lord Ieſus procea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth forth to ſhewe, euen as he hathe begun, that if a manne ſweare by hys heade, it is as wel to take the name of God indirectly, as it is to ſweare by heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or the earth, or by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</p>
                  <p>☞ Therefore as he hathe ſayed that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is Gods throne, the earth hys fote ſtole, Hieruſalem his holy citye: euen ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he declareth that a mans heade is a portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his ſeignory: for as much as he alone doth diſpoſe it after hys wyll.</p>
                  <p>As thoughe he woulde ſaye: who ſo euer doeth thynke that when he doeth ſweare by hys heade, he ſweareth by a thynge that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth pertayne vnto hym ſelfe, and that hys othe doeth not touche God, is abuſed. For God hathe alſo there his rule, in ſuche wyſe that man can do nothynge. Therfore it is all waies to take the name of God. We ſe how the Lorde hathe ſtyl continued hys purpoſe. Theſe brayneleſſe menne woulde tranſport it wyth theym for to make it leape quickelye from the cocke to the Aſſe.</p>
                  <p>The concluſion is, that our wordes ſhold
<pb facs="tcp:11396:44"/> be yea, yea, naye, naye: and that what ſo euer is more then that cometh of the euyll. Theſe wordes are eaſye to vnderſtand, were it not that theſe hogges do ouerthrow them wyth theyr groynes, in ſuche wyſe that they make them all confuſed.</p>
                  <p>For they ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this is as much, as if he had ſayed, that our purpoſes ſhoulde be, yea and naye, &amp; that it is euil done to admore the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Nowe the Lord Ieſus putteth eche of theſe wordes twyſe, to ſignifie that we oughte to be fyrme and conſtaunte in oure purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>As thoughe he woulde ſaie, do not chaunge, to retracte euery tyme your wordes: and that there be no leaſynge or hypocriſye in youre purpoſes. But let your yea be yea, and youre nay nay. And in dede I Iames, beyng in wil to geue the ſame doctrine, ſpeaketh euen ſo, worde for worde. Let your yea (ſayeth he) be yea, and your naye, naye, by whiche he ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, that all fayethfull men ought to haue a certen truth in their wordes. Which loyalty and trueth, if it were amonge vs, all othes ſhold be ſuperfluous. For this ſimplicitie of wordes, ſhoulde ſuffice to affirme and denye w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out ſwearyng. It muſt nedes be therefore that the trueth raigneth not, where othes be frequented. Therefore it is not wythout a cauſe, that our ſauiour ſayth that this thing doeth procede of euyl. And to ſaye troth, the cauſe whiche induceth vs to ſweare, is for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the whole worlde is ſo full of lying, cantels, fayninges, and falſheades, that ſcant is ther any that dare truſte his owne brother.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11396:45"/>
                  <p>Thus one euyll draweth to hym an other. But in al thys, the Lorde Ieſus meaneth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge of lawefull othes, whyche were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the law: but onely doeth reprehend and correcte that vnlawefull libertye of ſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge, whyche the people, beyng euyll inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted by euyll teachers, dyd vſe: fyrſt thincking that it was none othe to take the name of God in directlie: and tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after made no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of periuries, eſteminge alſo theſe vayne and lyghte as nothynge.</p>
                  <p>☞ Nowe that I haue ſufficientlye ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen all the foundations, vpon whyche the Anabaptiſtes, goyng about to condemne all othes wythout anye diſtinction or excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do leane: it reſteth nowe, that by good reaſons and teſtimones of the ſcriptur, I do ſhewe howe a Chriſtian maye lawefullye ſwere wythout offendyng God. Here I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſte agayne that thynge whiche I haue ſaid before: that is, that I intende not to vnbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del the worlde, to induce it to abuſe the name of God, in makynge othes at pleaſure and raſhelye. I knowe that that vyce is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: and therfore we oughte rather to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye to repreſſe it, than to agmente it. I knowe alſo that it is no ſmalle faute, to take the name of God in vayne, and therfore that we ought ſo much the more to trauell by all meanes to let ſuche an euyll. But howe? To condemne that whyche is good, whan we woulde take a waye the abuſe, is no good waye to procede. Wherefore, whan I ſaye that it is lawefull in a certayne caſe for a
<pb facs="tcp:11396:45"/> Chriſtian to ſwhere, I woulde euerye man ſhoulde thyncke that I meane of the righte vſe, whych is ioyned wyth the feare and reue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the name of God, &amp; that no man take occaſion of my wordes to make vaine, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fluous, or vicious othes. To define y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter more playnelye: whan I ſaye that a Chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man may ſwhere wythout offence, fyrſte I meane whan it behoueth to geue teſtimonye vnto the trueth. Secondlye if the thynge do require it: the whyche conſideration oughte to haue reſpecte vnto the honoure of God &amp; loue of our neyghboure. That is to ſay if it be expedient and profitable to ſwere, as well for Goddes honoure, as to conſerue charitie amongeſte vs. Thirdelye that neceſſitye do require it: that is to ſaye, that it be nedefull to vſe ſuche a confirmacion. Fourthlye that the deliberacion and intent of hym that ſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth be ſuch. Finalli that it be done in feare &amp; reuerence w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a deſire to ſanctifie the name of god. In ſuch a caſe, and none otherwyſe, I ſaye that the vſe of ſwerynge is permmitted to Chriſten men. Yf anye bragger do abuſe it: it ſhalbe to hys condemnacion.</p>
                  <p>☞ For confirmation of my ſaying, I wyll alledge the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manndement of God, in which I wyl abide. That is wher he ordeyned and commaundid, that men ſhoulde ſwere by his name: whan anye lawful cauſe were. Out of thys I conclud, that to ſwer, is not a thinge ſimple, and of it ſelfe euyll. For it cannot be, that the thinge which is euil ſhoulde at anye tyme pleaſe God.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11396:46"/>
                  <p>Moreouer, ſeynge it is a kynde of homage whiche the fayethfull do geue vnto God, as it is often tyme ſhewed in the Prophetes it is to manifeſt a reſiſtaunce vnto the truth, to ſaye that it is a vyce and ſynne. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is eaſye whyche is, that it is expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent manitymes that the veritie, which other wyſe is doubtfull, be confirmed: and ther is none other meanes but by othe. That which the Anabapteſtes do alledge touchynge the correction of thys commaundement is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſte blaſphemye. For ſo ſhoulde it follow that Ieſus Chriſte ſhoulde retracte that, whiche was once eſtabliſhed by God hys father. Whyche, as we haue ſhewed, can be by no meanes tollerable. And in dead, the A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeakyng of an oth, thoughe he ſpeake there of incidentlye treatynge an other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, doeth not ſay that the vſe therof is abro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gate: but calleth it the ende and deciſion of al controuerſies betwene men. I praye you whan the Apoſtel ſpekynge to Chriſten men doeth pronounce that an othe is to make an ende of al controuerſies, doeth he not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſignifie that it is an order approued of God, the whiche hath place in the Chriſten churche? What foliſhe boldnes is it than to be agaynſte it, and to reiecte thys remedye which is geuen vs, as thoughe it were a dam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nable vyce?</p>
                  <p>☞ Wyth this doctrine, ther be alſo the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emples, as well of God, as of all hys ſeruan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. Men, ſayth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtel in the place before alleged, do ſwere by the name of god becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:11396:46"/> he is aboue them: God ſwereth by hym ſelfe becauſe he hath no ſuperioure, but is aboue al. Touching God, the Anabaptiſtes do anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, that he maye well ſwere, for as much as he maye well accompliſhe all that he ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: and ſo is out of daunger of periurye, for as muche as he is fayethfull, and wyll kepe all that he promiſeth: but it is otherwyſe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a mortall man: the whyche manye tymes can not performe that whiche he hath promiſed all thoughe he woulde: and therefore it is fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſhe raiſhnes for hym to ſwere, byndynge hym ſelfe to that whyche is aboue hys po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. Whan they haue blaſted out into the eyre, thys ſolution, they thyncke they haue done, and that they haue ſtopped oure mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes. But the replication is redye: that they cannot ſaye the lyke of all the Patriarches, Prophetes, holye kynges, and aunciente fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whyche haue alſo ſworne after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſample of God, beholde Abrahame the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all fayethfull menne whyche hath ſworene. Beholde Iſaac, beholde Iacob, Dauyd, Ezechias, and Ioſias whyche haue done lykewyſe. What difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wene them and vs? Therefore it maye well apere that ther anſwer here aboue is a meere cauillacion.</p>
                  <p>☞ Yf, to auoyde thys they wyll alledge, that theſe be exemples taken out of the olde Teſtamenete: and that nowe in the Chriſten churche we haue a harder brydell: thoughe thys erroure be all redye refuted
<pb facs="tcp:11396:47"/> yet wyll we ſhewe that it helpeth theym no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge. For we wyll brynge forth for vs, the Apoſtles, whyche haue alſo vſed othes, yea, euen in theyr wrytynges when neade requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Nowe lette vs heare theyr prety excuſe whyche they make to auoyde thys.</p>
                  <p>Saynte Peter and .S. Paul ſaie they, dyd not ſweare to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſe anye thynge: but onely to aſſure y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promyſe made by god:</p>
                  <p>Here may we clearly ſe, howe they whiche do deliberate to ſpeake agaynſte the trueth, do wrepe them ſelues in a thouſande abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dites, and yet haue no ſhame of theyr impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie. Fyrſte, in that they make ſuch an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, they graunt vnto vs that ther be ſome lawefull othes: that is when a manne doeth wytneſſe thynges paſte. For it foloweth of theyr wordes, that then onely is the oth euil, when we promiſe a thynge to come.</p>
                  <p>Are they not paſte ſhame, ſo euidently to lye, goynge aboute to perſwade that we ſee not that thynge whyche we ſe?<note place="margin">ii. Cor. i.</note> Saynte Paule ſweareth vnto the Corhynthyans, that he came not vnto them, bycauſe he would ſpare them.<note place="margin">Rom. ix.</note> He ſweareth vnto the Romayns, that he woulde be contente to be caſte oute from Chriſte,<note place="margin">ii. Cor. xii.</note> that the Iewes myght be ſaued. To confyrme hys loue whyche he bare vnto the Phyllyppians, he ſware alſo. Alſo vnto the Corhynthyans he ſwaer that hys conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:11396:47"/> was amonge them in a good conſcience. Alſo he ſweareth vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Theſſalonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that he came not vnto theim for couetuouſnes, or for any profytte, and calleth God to wytnes howe holylye he lyued amonge theim. Theſe phreneticalles do ſaye, that the Apoſtles dyd neuer ſwere to affirme any thynge touchyng theyr owne matter: but onely whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhold teſtifye the couenaunte of God. I praye you what doeth ſuche impudency deſerue? At the leaſt, are they worthye that a man ſhoulde o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen hys mouthe to ſpeake vnto them?</p>
                  <p>Notwythſtandynge wee wyll open thys doubte, whyche they putte forthe, whyche is, that a man oughte not wyth an othe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe any thynge, bycauſe it lyeth not in hym to perfourme it.</p>
                  <p>To thys I anſwere, that when a ſubiecte ſweareth vnto hys Prynce, to do hys dutye, in obeyinge, and beinge fayethful vnto him: he doeth not thys in confidence of hys owne power, or vauntyng hym ſelfe as diſpiſynge God, and ſettynge him at nought: but rather in calling vpon the healpe of God, he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that hys wyll ſhal be ſuche as it oughte to be. Howe be it, it is a folyſhe imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to reproue othes, and yet to permitte ſymple promiſes. For if there be foliſhe raſhnes in the one, ſo is ther alſo in the other.</p>
                  <p>Therefore if it be lawefull for vs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſe, they muſte ſhew a reaſon why we may not aſſertayne our promiſe, by an othe, when neceſſitie requireth vs, That in ſuche a caſe, an othe is holy and lawefull, we haue many
<pb facs="tcp:11396:48"/> exemples in holye ſtripture: and among all thre, whych be very notable. It is ſayed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boke of the Cronicles, that Aſa kyng of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, beinge admoniſhed by Azarias ſacrificer and Prophet, called all the people into Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and there cauſed them to ſweare to ſerue God for euer. As muche is wrytten of Ioſias, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the boke of the lawe was fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that for to renewe the couenaunte made by Moyſes, he ſware the people, makinge them promiſe to perſeuer for euer in the obedience of God The thyrde exemple is of Eſdras &amp; Nehemias, at whoſe inſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng returned from Babilon, dyd ſweare, for euer after to followe we God and hys word. If we do wel conſider the thinge, the lyke was done at the firſte publication of the lawe.</p>
                  <p>But bycauſe I knowe that I haue to do with brayneles &amp; obſtinate people, I would aledge none, but ſuche places, where is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly made mention of othes. Ye ſe then howe the whole churche of Iſraell, made ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne othes vnto god, promiſing that thing whiche is mooſte hard to be kepte, that is, to cleaue fayethfullye vnto hym. Thys is done often tymes. That the Acte is good, there is no doubte. For it hathe wytnes, and is alſo prayſed of the holy Goſt. I wyll not greatly ſtand in thys, to declare howe men may this bynde them ſelues to God, to do that which is not in theim: but onely putte you in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of that thynge whyche I haue tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the waye, that the fayethfull do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes preſuppoſe that God wyll not fayle
<pb facs="tcp:11396:48"/> them of hys grace whyche he hath promiſed them: and vpon that they grounde theyr oth. But ſeyng that it is ſo, that god hath appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thys kynde of othe, and that hys churche hath often tymes vſed it by hys ordinaunce: I aſke of our dulheades, by what authority they dare reproue it? or rather wythout trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blynge my ſelfe wyth them, bicauſe it is time loſte. I deſyre and exhorte all ſeruauntes of God to conſider what boldenes theſe poore ignoraunte menne haue, to make ſuche Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrall determinations, and to go aboute to conſtrayne the worlde to receyue theim as thynges irreuorable and not to be agayne ſayde.</p>
                  <p>☞ For my parte I doubte not, but that in the matter of an othe, as in the other before, I haue fullye ſatiſfied all ſuche as haue eares and vnderſtandinge, and be in will to conſent vnto the trueth knowne.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:11396:49"/> were it not that they haue left two Articles of as greate conſequence, as any of the other of the whyche it is neadfull to ſpeake, for as much as al the Anabaptiſtes do communely cleaue to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Beſides this, I know that thei whyche compoſed thys goodlye reſolution, dyd at that tyme teache them.</p>
               <p>The one is, that they do not beleue that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte was a verye man: but rather do make hym touchinge hys bodye, a phantaſy.</p>
               <p>The other is, that they do thynke that the ſoules beynge ſeperated from theyr bodyes, do ſlepe vnto the daye of Iudgement, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute fealynge or knowynge anye thynge: or elſe that the ſoule of man is noughte els but hys lyfe, the whyche defaileth in dienge, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuche tyme as he be rayſed vp againe, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye man may ſe the conſequence whych theſe two errours do emporte.</p>
               <p>That they haue ſpoken neuer a worde of theſe, I can not tell whether it be by crafte, bicauſe they be ſo odious, that by goodright they ſhoulde make theyr whole doctrine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerable. For what cauſe ſo euer it be, ſeynge I haue taken vpon me to arme all fayethful people, agaynſte theyr faulſe opinions: it is not good that I ſhoulde diſſimble theſe two ſo peſtilente and miſcheuouſe opinions, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge they are commune to them al.</p>
               <p>Touchynge that ſome amonge them haue holden opinion that all goodes ſhoulde be commune, alſo that a man maye haue manye wyues, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled ſome whiche were contente wyth one, to take moe, and a
<pb facs="tcp:11396:49"/> thouſande other abſurdites: I wyll ſpeake nothynge at al. For they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues beyng co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed in ther ſelues haue for the moſt part by littel and littel w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues. But tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge the twoe Articles, wher of I haue ſpoken, there is an other reſon: for as muche as they al do hold them yet ſtyl,</p>
               <p>☞ Touchyng the fyrſt: which is of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, or humayne nature of oure Lord Ieſus Chriſte, it is to be noted that ther was twoe aunciente hereſies like, or approchynge vnto thys, whyche theſe do holde. For the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches phantaſied, that Ieſus Chriſt, brought an heauenlye bodye, into the wombe of the Vyrgen his mother. The Marcioniſtes had a vayne dreme ſome what differente from the other, that he had not a verye ſubſtaunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bodye: but onelye an apperaunce, or lyke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of a bodye: whyche we call a phataſiye. The purpoſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one and of the other, was to denye that Ieſus Chriſt take fleſhe of the virgin. Therfore we ſe that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Anabaptiſtes, in thys behalffe, do but ſtur vp the errours. whyche the dyuyl had rayſed more than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tene hundereth yeres paſt, and were coufou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the worde of God. Notwythſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge, as in the begynnynge I haue prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, I wyll not that it hys ſhalbe anye preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice vnto there cauſe, excepte I do conuince them fyrſte, by the pure worde of God, ſo as if it hadde neuer be ſpoken of before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> anye manne. Thys that I do ſpeake is onelye to geue warnynge, that all men maye knowe, out of what fountaine procedeth that which
<pb facs="tcp:11396:50"/> the Anabaptiſts now bryng forth, as though it were reueled vnto them, latlye from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen And alſo to geue warnynge vnto them ſelues. For all the greate doctours whyche were of their ſeete, haue bene ſo ignoraunte of the hiſtories, and of all auncientie, that I thinke neuer a one of them can tell ſo muche as what thys name Marcion is. It is good therefore, that as well they as other, be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed, that the fyrſte author of thys opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, where wyth they do troble the worlde, was caſte out and accurſſed wyth hys opni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not of a fewe, but of the whole Chriſten churche, ſhortly after, that is, wyth in fortye yerres after the deth of the Apoſtelles. For Euſebyus and Saincte Hierome do wryte that Policarpe, diſciple and familiar frende of Saincte Iohn the Apoſtel, metynge hym at Rome, called hym the eldeſt ſonne of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than. I wyll not recite the other errours, wherwyth he troubled the church. For wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thys is wel plucked out, men ſhal wel know I truſt, that heardly may there be founde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye one, more execrable.</p>
               <p>☞ Fyrſt I wyll ſhewe by manye and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſure teſtimones of ſcripture, that the Lord Ieſus dyd verilye take fleſhe and mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whan he was reueled vnto vs in thys world, by God his father: and I wil proue it ſo playnelye, that there ſhall not be ſo littell a chylde, whyche ſhall not perceyue, that it ſhallbe to greate an impudencie for the Anabaptiſtes to kycke anye more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſte it. As it ſhall not be nedefull to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:11396:50"/> al the places of ſcripture whyche myghte ſerue to thys purpoſe. So to auoyde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixitie, I wyll take thoſe whych ſeme to be moſte couenable. We knowe that at the firſt begynnynge of the worlde, the Lorde promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed heua, that her ſeede ſhould ouer come the ſerpente.</p>
               <p>Lette vs ſe if thys be accompliſhed in vs, or whether it haue euer bene accompliſhed in anye mortall man, but onelye by the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Ieſus Chriſte, whiche hath, for vs, vanquiſhed and ouercome Sathan. But becauſe thys promes was yet ſomewhat ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, it hath bene ſence made muche more cleare, boeth to Abraham, and Iacob: whan it was ſayde vn them, that in there ſede all the nacions of the earth ſhoulde be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>☞ Nowe, this ſede, as Sayncte Paulle doeth interprete it, and reaſon ſheweth the ſame, is Ieſus Chriſte.</p>
               <p>Therefore the promes cannot otherwyſe be verified, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ieſus Chriſtis deſcended of the ſtocke of Abraham. Lykewyſe whan it was ſaied vnto Dauid: I wil ſet the fruit of thie wombe, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſeat to raigne euer laſtingely. And lykewyſe, whan in the ſame ſence, it is confirmed by the prophet Eſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhalbe as a bud proceding out of the rooett of I ſaie: we know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſame ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be otherwiſe vnderſtanded, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſame redemer whych was promiſed vnto Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Therfore it muſt neds be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he be of the ligne of Dauyd, as touchynge the generacion of
<pb facs="tcp:11396:51"/> the fleſhe: or els the promes is voyde. For thys cauſe Sayncte Mathew goynge about to recite hys genealogy, beginneth the, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge hym the ſon Dauid, the ſonne of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he myght the more expreſly ſpecifye, that he was the ſelfe ſame that was promyſed. And in dede, it was a manner of ſpeche, very commonlye vſed amonge the people of the Iewes, ſo to name him: as we may ſe by the Euangeliſtes.</p>
               <p>¶ Vnto al this, the Anabaptiſtes make one ſoluacion, the whiche a lone doeth ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye declare what beaſtes they be, and howe deſperate ther impudencie is. He is, ſay thei, called Dauiddes ſonne, not becauſe that he toke anye thyng of the virgen marye, or that he was made man of hir ſubſtaunce: but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye becauſe ſhe bere hym in her bodye: as wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter paſſeth by a pype. Thys myght be ſayd, if thys worde ſede, were not expreſſed. How be it touchynge the truth, all men of good Iudgemente myghte ſe that it were but a craftye euacion. Notwythſtandynge there myghte be a littell more colour, or ſhadowe. But ſeynge this is ſo often repeted, that he is of the ſede of Abraham: what cauilaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can be made to denye hym to be verye man? And in deade, whan Eſaias promiſed hys commynge, he ſayeth not ſymplye that he ſhallbe the chylde of a vyrgin: but he ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth fyrſt that he ſhalbe conceyued This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception imparteth that he ſhoulde be formed of hir ſede: as they whyche do knowe the ſig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nificacion of the word, can wel Iudg.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11396:51"/>
               <p>☞ Moreouer Saynte Paule doth expreſſe thys thynge more playnelye, when he ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that he was made of the ſeede of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid touchynge the fleſhe, and was notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandynge declared the ſonne of God by his power. Beholde, Ieſus Chriſte on the one parte, is called the ſonne of God: and againe he addeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as touching his humaine nature he is of the ſtocke of Dauid. Is not that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very madde, whyche doth cloſe his eyes, and ſtoppe hys eares agaynſt all thys, to perſiſte &amp; mayntayne the contrary, that Ieſus Chriſt hathe no parte of the nature of man as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng the ſubſtaunce of hys body? Likewiſe in an other place, the ſame Apoſtle, ſpeaking of the dignitie and noblenes of the Iewes, among other thinges ſayeth, that they be the ſucceſſours and progenye of the fathers, of whom Chriſte is aſſended as touchynge the fleſhe. I paſſe ouer manye other places: as where he ſayeth, that God was manifeſted in fleſhe: alſo, he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuffered in humilitie of the fleſhe. Lykewyſe where ſaynte Iohn ſayeth, that the word was made fleſh: and beſides al thys, where he ſo often tymes doth attribute vnto hym ſelfe the title of the ſonne of man, and other lyke places: bycauſe it ſhoulde be ſuperfluouſe, after theſe two notable places which I haue aledged.</p>
               <p>I thynke it therefore ſufficiente, to brynge forthe theſe places, the which do at the fyrſte ſyghte boeth proue myne intention, and alſo declare howe neceſſarie it is for vs, to beleue that the Lord Ieſus hath put on, and verilie
<pb facs="tcp:11396:52"/> taken our nature when he was made man. The Apoſtle in the epiſtle vnto the Hebrues taketh a goodly argumente, to amplyfye the loue whyche he beareth vnto vs, bycauſe he toke not the nature of Angels: but of vs. If we do receiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taſy of theſe vnhappy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thys grace and ineſtimable goodnes of the Lorde Ieſus ſhall be cleane put oute of oure memorye, for wee ſhall not perceyue that he hath any more honoured vs, then he hath the Aungels.</p>
               <p>He ſayeth further, that by the meanes of the communication whyche he hathe w<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs in hys fleſhe, and hys bloude, he calleth him ſelfe oure brother, and is verely oure brother By thys we maye conclude, that the greateſt benefite whyche we may haue, ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from vs, if Ieſus Chriſt do not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with vs in fleſhe and bloude.</p>
               <p>For howe ſhoulde we be the chyldren of God, wythout beynge hys brethren? Nowe the Apoſtle ſayeth, that we obtayne thys bycauſe he is ioyned vnto vs in one nature, &amp; by none other meanes. He addeth further that it was neceſſary that he ſhoulde be like vnto hys brethren, that he myght be a fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full interceſſoure and pittyfull. Wheroute he deduceth a ſinguler conſolation, that we haue an aduocate whiche wyll haue compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion on oure infirmities, ſeynge that he him ſelfe was tempted, beyng in all thynges like vnto vs, excepte ſynne.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, for as muche as in the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude whyche he putteth betwene vs, and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb facs="tcp:11396:52"/> Chriſt, he maketh no difference but ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it foloweth, that in all the reſt, he is lyke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, thys vnderſtanded, that in that place he ſpeaketh namelye of the humayne nature. In theſe places we do not onely ſe, how the Lorde Ieſus is verily our brother in vnitie of one ſelfe nature: but alſo the profit whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che we haue thereby: of the whyche they do ſpoyle and depryue vs, whyche do attribute vnto hym. I can not tell what heauenly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whych hath nothyng co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ours.</p>
               <p>In lyke maner all the diſputation whych Saynte Paule maketh to the Corynthyans to proue oure vniuerſall reſurrection in the reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſte can not ſtande if he haue not a nature commune wyth vs. Seynge Chriſte is riſen ſayeth he, wee ſhall ryſe agayne, and if we ſhall not ryſe agayne then is Chriſte not riſen agayne.</p>
               <p>It were eaſye to replye agaynſte thys: if it myght be aledged that Ieſus Chriſt brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghte an heauenlye bodye wyth hym, into hys mothers wombe.</p>
               <p>For that were no maruayle, that a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce whyche came frome heauen, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from corruption. And ſo ſhoulde it not followe of that, that oure bodyes why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che are earthlye, and haue in them nothynge but corrupte mattier ſhoulde aryſe agayne. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Therefore that all ſuche deductions maye be fyrme and ſure: it is neceſſarye that oure Sauioure Ieſus Chriſte be pertaker wyth vs in one ſelfe nature.</p>
               <p>For therein lyeth the whole hope that we

By this meanes I ſaye, we haue a good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, &amp; ſurety for to certifie vs: and otherwiſe not. In an other place, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame apoſtle going aboute to ſhewe howe that the Lorde Ieſus is our mediatoure, ſayeth expreſlye that he is man, bycauſe he knewe well that we coulde neuer be induced to draw our ſelues toward hym, vnleſſe we hadde fyrſte thys perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he is oure neyghboure, and that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Therefore in thys thinge lyeth and reſteth oure confidence to make vs to truſte in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte, and to ſeke hym for oure meadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour, bycauſe he is ioyned vnto vs, &amp; doeth perticipate wyth vs in one ſelfe nature.</p>
               <p>And that is it which Eſaias meaneth, wher he ſayeth, that he was made Emanuell, that is to ſaye, God with vs. For that can not be wythout true ſimilitude and vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of nature.</p>
               <p>Vnto thys purpoſe ther be yet other perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory reaſons: the whych thoughe they be not expreſſed in holy ſcripture: yet be they neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles true. For as muche as they be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the ſame.</p>
               <p>For that it was neceſſary, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he whych ſhuld be our mediator ſhould be verye God &amp; verye ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it appeareth in the office of a mediatour, whyche is to reconcile menne to God, and to put away the mortall enmitie, whyche was before. Nowe was there no hope that thys
<pb facs="tcp:11396:53"/> ſhoulde be done, excepte that the maieſtye of God dyd diſcende vnto vs, ioynynge hym ſelfe with the infirmitie of our nature. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe the office of a mediatour was, to make vs the chyldren of God, and inheritours of hys kyngedome, wher as we were the heyres of death and damnation.</p>
               <p>Thys is therfore the earneſte to confyrme our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence, that we be the chyldre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god, for as muche as the naturall ſonne of God hath taken a bodye of oure bodye, and fleſhe of oure fleſh, to be made one wyth vs. More ouer it was neceſſary to our rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhold be repared again in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſam nature Therefore the Lorde Ieſus came a very ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, preſentynge hym ſelfe as in the perſon of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, of whom he alſo toke the name: that he myght paye the payne of ſyn in that fleſhe in the which it was committed.</p>
               <p>Therfore they which do ſpoile Ieſus Chriſt of hys humayne nature, do not onely muche obſcure hys goodneſſe, but they do vs alſo greate wronge in deſtroyinge the true obiect whych we haue, to haue right &amp; ful affiaunce in hym. And leſt it ſhould apere that I do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſimule any thynge of that whyche myghte ſerue for that purpoſe. I wyll brynge forthe all thoſe places whyche ſeme to geue any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to theyr phantaſye.</p>
               <p>Saynte Paule in a certen place, ſaith, that Ieſus Chriſt made him ſelfe of no reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> takyng the forme of a ſeruaunt, beinge made lyke to men, and in apparaunce of no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, takynge the forme of a ſeruaunte, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge
<pb facs="tcp:11396:54"/> made lyke to men, and in apparaunce ſhewed hym ſelfe a man. Out of thys, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion doeth conclude, that hys bodye was a fantaſye. The Anabaptiſtes at thys daye conclude oute of thys place that hys bodye was not ſuche as ours is.</p>
               <p>The anſweare to thys is verye eaſye. For Saynte Paule doeth not ſpeake of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce of Chriſtes bodye, but doeth onelye ſhewe, that thoughe it ſo be, that he myghte ſhewe hym ſelfe in his gloryouſe maieſtie as God: yet he behaued hym ſelfe as a ſymple man in all mekenes. He exhorteth the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyppians to humilitie. To do thys, he bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Chriſt for exemple: ſaynge that he was in the forme that is to ſaye, in the glorye of God, and that notwythſtandynge he made hym ſelfe of no reputation. He addeth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde that he ſhewed hym ſelfe in the forme of manne, and that he behaued hym ſelfe as man. What other thing do theſe worde ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, but that vnder the vaile of hys fleſhe in whyche he appeared little &amp; contemptible, he hyd the glory of hys diuinitie, in ſuche wyſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther appeared in him but the trayle condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he outwardlye ſhewed. Thus as touchynge the ſolution of thys place, ther is no difficultye. But ther is an other, the why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che ſemeth to haue a litle more of apparau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce It is in the .xv. Chapter of the fyrſte Epiſtle to the Corinthyans, wher ſaynt Paule ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the fyrſte Adam was earthly, made of the earth: the ſeconde is heauenlye, beynge come from heauen. Out of thys the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſtes
<pb facs="tcp:11396:54"/> after the example of theyr predeceſſors the Maniches, do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude that Ieſus Chriſt had an heauenly bodye, and not formed nor created of humayne ſeede: that is to ſaye of the ſubſtaunce of hys mother the virgyn. The ſolution of thys argumente, is eaſye, if we beholde. S. Paules purpoſe, and do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and knyt one ſentence wyth an other, and not cutte of and ſnatche one worde to the deprauation of the whole ſence.</p>
               <p>Saynte Paule there goynge aboute to proue whence commeth deathe, and whence commeth reſurrection frome death. That is to ſay, the fyrſt of Adam, the ſeconde of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte, among other thynges ſayd, that Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was made a lyuing ſoule: Ieſus Chriſt a quickenynge ſpirite. Nowe by thys he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not to denye that Ieſus Chriſte had a ſoule lyke vnto ours, but he doeth ſignifye that he had a greater thynge: that is to ſaye hys ſpirite whyche is not onely lyuynge: but hath in hym ſelfe the vertue to quycke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Then he addeth further, that the fyrſt Adam was earthly, for as muche as he was of the earth and that Ieſus Chriſte is heauenlye, beyng come from heauen.</p>
               <p>¶ There is no doubte but that thys place oughte to be vnderſtande as the other, of the qualitie of Ieſus Chriſte, and not of the ſubſtaunce. I meane of that vertue ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and diuine, which he hath fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen as the ſonne of God, and not of the earth as a mortall manne.</p>
               <p>And in dede, as we haue ſaid, the ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of
<pb facs="tcp:11396:55"/> the argument whyche ſaynte Paule maketh ther, to confyrme vs in the hope of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection were nothynge, if Ieſus Chriſte had an other ſubſtaunce of bodye then we,</p>
               <p>They aledge further, that it was conceyued of the holy Goſte. But this vertue of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Goſte, is not to exclude the ſubſtaunce of hys mother. It is true that there was no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of man and woman to beget hym after the naturall courſe of other men</p>
               <p>But that is no impedimente, to the meruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe operation of the holy Goſte, by which he was formed of the ſubſtaunce of hys mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he myght be the very ſede of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and fruite of the wombe of Dauid: as the ſame holy Gooſte had longe tyme before named hym.</p>
               <p>I knowe theyr anſwere to this is, that this inconuenience ſhold folow, that foras much as the whole ſede of manne, is a curſed and corrupted, ſo ſhoulde the Lorde Ieſus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend of corruption But I anſwer that this miraculos conception taketh awaye that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficultie.

                  </gap> the workynge of the holy Goſt was to that ende to ſanctifie hym frome the begynnynge, and in ſanctifiynge to preſerue hym from all ſpottes of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s fylthynes. For thys cauſe S Paule ſayed, that he toke the ſimilitude of ſynfull fleſhe, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne ſinne in the fleſhe. For in takynge oure fleſhe, he toke not the ſynne, for as muche as the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the holye Goſte dyd ſeperate from the condition o the other.</p>
               <p>They haue alſo a folyſhe and fantaſticall
<pb facs="tcp:11396:55"/> conſideration, that they thinke that it ſholde be a diſhonorynge to Ieſus Chriſte, to make hym ſo lowe, that he ſhoulde be of lyke na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to vs: and therefore they thynke that it appertayneth better to hys dignitie, to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute vnto hym an heauenly bodye.</p>
               <p>I anſwere that it is greate folye to eſteme that the glory af Chriſte is any thynge leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or that it doeth anye thinge derogate to hys dignitie, to ſaye that he humilied, yea made hym ſelfe of no reputation, for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and ſaluation.</p>
               <p>There is muche more ſayed of hym in the xxii pſalme, that he is a worme and no man, the opprobrye and abiection of the people. Lykewyſe that whyche Eſayas ſayeth is muche more, that he was eſtemed as one of no valure, rekened as a lipper, cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the numbre of euyll doers. But can a manne ſaye more then Saynte Paule hathe ſayed? That is, that he was accurſed, and made an execration for vs? if thys diminyſhe hys ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure, then muſte we be aſhamed to confeſſe that he was crucified for vs. For thys word crucifiyng is a more ignominios word, then at thys day is the gallowes.</p>

                  <head>¶ The ſecond Article,</head>
                  <p>IT is tyme that I do come vnto the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Article of the which I promiſed to treat: That is that the Anabaptiſtes commune<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly all do hold opinion, that the ſoules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng departed from the bodye, do no more lyue, vntyll the day of the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be it they do ſomewhat differ amonge them ſelues. For ſome of theym do thinke that the ſoule is not a ſubſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or a creature haui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge
<pb facs="tcp:11396:56"/> an eſſenſiall beynge: but that it is onely the vertue that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath to breathe, to moue, and to do other actions of lyfe, whylſe he is yet a lyue. The other do confeſſe that the ſoule is an eſſenſiall creature, and yet neuertheles do Imagyn that the ſoules of theym that be deade, do ſlepe wythout any ſence, or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandynge, vntyl the daye of iudgemente. Therefore if we ſhall thorowlye confute the Anabaptiſtes, we muſte fyrſte ſhewe that the ſoules haue an eſſenſial being of theyr own.</p>
                  <p>Secondelye: that after deathe, they do felt and knowe theyr condition and eſtate, but before we go any further in thys matter: we muſte note that thys worde Soule, is diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlye taken in the ſcripture. Fyrſte: for the lyfe, as where it is fayed in Iob, I beare my ſoule in my handes. Alſo in ſaynt Mathewe is not the ſoule more then the meate? and in infinite other places.</p>
                  <p>Sometyme it is taken for the wyll or the deſyre, as where it is ſayed in Samuel, that the ſoule of Ionathas was knytte to the ſoule of Dauid. And in the Actes, wher it is ſayd the multitude of beleuers had one hert, &amp; one ſoule Somtime it is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the whole man, as wher it is ſayd, that there deſcended into Egypt wyth Iacob three ſcore and fyf, tene ſoules. Alſo wher the Prophet pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth that the ſoule which ſynneth ſhal dye. Alſo, for breathinge or blowynge, as in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muell, where Saull ſayeth. I am ouercome wyth angwyſhe, thoughe all my Soule be yet in me.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11396:57"/>
                  <p>Lykewyſe, when Eliſeus ſayed that the ſoule of the chyld dyd returne into hys bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. Fynallye, when it is ioyned wyth thys worde ſpirite, it ſignifieth an affection, as when Eſaias ſayed: my ſoule deſyereth the in the night, and I watch vnto the in my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rite. Alſo ſaynte Paule prayeth God to kepe the Theſſalonians vndefyled in bodye, and in ſpirite, and in ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Lykewyſe thys word ſpirit, is diuerſly ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of whych I nede not now make long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration: but onely thys, that we know that it is often tymes taken for the ſoule, as it ſhall euidently appeare in thoſe places, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che hereafter ſhall be alledged.</p>
                  <p>Thys beynge noted let vs ſe whether the ſoule of man haue an eſſenſuall beyng of hir owne, whiche is geuen to hyr of God. And let vs beginne at the creation of man, which wyll helpe muche to thys marter, Touching Beaſtes and other lyuynge creatures, God doeth commaunde them to be made ſymplye. When he commeth to the makynge of man, be entreth into conſultation, ſayinge. Let vs make ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to our Image and lykenes. Nowe where ſhall we fynde thys Image of God, excepte there be a ſpirituall eſſence in man, in whyche it is imprynted.</p>
                  <p>For the bodye is not that thynge, wherein the Image of God is reſidente. It is true, that Moyſes by and by addeth, that manne was made a lyuynge ſoule, whyche thing he doeth ſaye alſo of Beaſtes. But to declare a ſpeciall excellencye, he ſaith. That God hath
<pb facs="tcp:11396:57"/> inſpired the vertue of lyfe in the bodye why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che he made of the earth. Therefore thoughe the ſoule of man haue certayne qualities co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune wyth thoſe of beaſtes: yet for as much as ſhe beareth the Image &amp; lykenes of God, ſhe is of condition differente from the other, And for as much alſo as ſhe hath hyr begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng apart, ſhe is of an other preheminence, and thys is it that Solomon meaneth, where he ſayeth, that in deathe, the bodye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth vnto the earth, whence it was taken and the ſoule returneth to God, whych gaue it. And therfore it is ſayd in the boke of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pience. That man is immortall, in that he is created to the Image of God. It is no aute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyke boke of the ſcripture, but yet is there no inconuenience, that wee vſe the teſtimonye thereof, as we maye do of an aunciente doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toure, how be it, thys onely reaſon oughte to ſuffice vs, that the ſame image of God whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was ſet in man, can not be but in a ſpirit immortall, if we marke well what it doeth containe after ſaint Paules expoſition: that is, that we do reſemble God in ryghtuouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and true holines. Thys muche is ſayed touchynge the creation.</p>
                  <p>☞ Nowe are there manye places in holye ſcripture, whyche are muche more euidente as where Sainte Peter ſayeth, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde of oure fayth, is the ſaluation of our ſoules. Alſo where he ſayeth that the fayeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full do purifie theyr ſoules. Agayne that the deſyres of the fleſhe do fyghte agaynſte the ſoule. Alſo, where he calleth Chriſte the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb facs="tcp:11396:58"/> of oure ſoules. For theſe ſentences can not conſiſte, excepte there be ſoules whyche be ſaued, and whych be aſſaulted by euil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcences, &amp; whyche be purified from their ſpottes, and gouerned by Ieſus Chriſt their byſhop. Accordynge to thys, it is ſayed in the hyſtorye of Iob, that men do dwel in earthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> houſſes, whych maner of ſpeakyng. S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vſeth, where he ſayeth, that he wyll ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyſhe the fayethfull, as longe as he ſhall dwell in hys earthlye tabernacle. If it were not that the pryncipall parte of manne dyd dwell in the bodye, as in a tabernacle, thys ſhoulde be ſpoken wythout reaſon.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle alſo, in his Epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues, declareth, as muche, or more expreſlye the ſame thynge, where he ſayeth, that oure fathers whych begat vs in thys worlde, are fathers of oure fleſhe: but God onelye is father of our ſpirites. I praye you, how ſhal we vnderſtande theſe wordes, if the ſoule be not an eſſenſiall thynge? and a lyttle after, ſpeakynge of the citezyns of heauen, he ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that they be the Aungels, and ſpirites of Iuſte men. Woulde we haue a more cleare proſte then this? Alſo I ſe not howe we ſhal expounde the exhortation whyche. S. Paule maketh vnto vs, that we ſhold purge vs, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all fylthynes of the fleſhe and the ſpirite, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we take this word ſpirit for an eſſential ſoule. For as the bodye is a ſubiecte, whych receyueth pollutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo muſte it needes be, that the ſoule on hyr behalfe, be a creature which may be polluted, &amp; ſanctified.</p>
                  <p>☞ There is a lyke reaſon, in that where
<pb facs="tcp:11396:58"/> he ſayth in an other place, that the ſpirite of god beareth wytnes to our ſpirites, that we be the chyldren of God. Howbeit, if we dyd hold that principle, whiche oughte to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, amongeſt vs chriſten me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we ſhould not nede to enter into diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this matter: that is to ſay, whether the ſoule be an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiall ſubſtaunce, or no: ſeynge that thys was the errour of the Saduces, whyche expreſlye is reproued in the ſcripture. For in the .xxiii. of the Actes it is ſaied, that ſaint Paule, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge about to excuſe hym ſelfe, doeth proteſt that he was perſecuted bicauſe he did not ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>proue the ſect of the Saduces. And Saynte Luke declaryng what this ſecte was, ſayeth that the Saduces do not beleue the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor that there be any Aungels, or anye ſpirites, or ſoules. What wyl we haue more then thys? S Paule confeſſeth, that he is a Phariſee in hys Articles. Now is it playne that the Phariſeis do confeſſe, as ſayeth Saynte Luke, that the ſoules be verye eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiall creatures.</p>
                  <p>☞ Therefore lette the Anabaptiſtes, take the quarell of the Saduces, theyr predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, and defende it agaynſt ſaynte Paule. And when they haue wonne theyr cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſte hym, then ſhall we ſe what we canne ſaye vnto them. In the meane whyle, we, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowynge the whole doctryne of God, wyll holde for certayne, that manne is compoſed and conlifteth of two partes, that is to ſay, of bodye and ſoule</p>
                  <p>It is now tyme to come vnto the .ii. point:
<pb facs="tcp:11396:59"/> that is, what is the eſtate of the ſoules, after the ſeparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their bodies. The Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtes do thinke that they be a ſlepe, like dead We ſaye they haue lyfe and felynge: and that it ſo is, we haue the teſtimony of Ieſus Chriſte, where he exhorteth his diſciples, not to feare them whyche do kyll the bodye, and haue no power to kyll the ſoule, but to feare hym whyche after he hathe kylled the bodye, can caſte the ſoule into hell fyre, if the ſoule were nothynge, or that ſhee were as kylled, when ſhe is ſeparate frome the bodye, then were it not true, that tyrauntes and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours haue no power ouer hyr.</p>
                  <p>Thus hath God ſhewed greate mercy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, in that he hathe not made oure ſoules ſubiecte vnto theſe hangmen, whyche wolde do worſſe and more cruellye then all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutours of the worlde: whyche is, woulde murther oure ſoules wyth oure bodies. But let vs heare theyr propre cauelation.</p>
                  <p>It is true ſaye they, that the Soule dyeth for the tyme, but ſhe doeth not vtterly periſh, for as muche as ſhee ſhall ryſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne.</p>
                  <p>☞ I aſke them, what doeth the body? For if the ſoule doeth not dye, alonely bycauſe of the hope, whyche ſhe hathe bycauſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, the ſame reaſon may be made for the bodye, that he doeth not peryſhe nother.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11396:59"/>
                  <p>Nowe the Lorde Ieſus doeth notably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne betwene the one and the other, ſayinge that the body is ſtaine, and not the ſoule. In thys maner, ſpake Ieſus Chriſte, when he ſayed vnto the Iewes: deſtroye thys temple, and I wyll reedifye it in thre dayes. Saynte Iohn added, that he ſpake of the temple of hys body: thus he reſerued the ſoule a parte, ſignifiynge that he coulde not be diſtroyed: and in dede when he dyed, he commended hir vnto God hys father.</p>
                  <p>And ſaynte Stephan after hys enſample. Lorde Ieſus (ſayed he) receyue my ſpirite. Thys oughte we therefore to thynke, that God is protectour of our ſoules, to preſerue them from the tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny of men, that when we ſhoulde dye, euerye one of vs ſhoulde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende hys ſoule vnto hym.</p>
                  <p>Lykewyſe when ſaynte Peter ſayeth, that the Lorde Ieſus came in hys ſpirite, to the ſpirites that were in pryſon, he doeth clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtifye by hys wordes, that the Soules haue ſence and vnderſtandynge ofter death. For otherwyſe they ſhoulde not perceyue the preachynge of Chriſte, whyche as he ſayeth, dyd preache vnto them. I confeſſe that thys place hath bene taken for a darke place, and that it hath bene diuerſly expounded: but yet w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll I aledge nothing for my purpoſe, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is not certayne. The Apoſtle therfore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge before ſpoken howe Chriſte was hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milied, and hauynge alſo ſhewed howe that all fayethfull men muſte be made lyke vnto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hym, for conſolation, he addeth that Ieſus
<pb facs="tcp:11396:60"/> Chriſt was not ouercome by death, but that he ouercame death. After this, to certifie vs that thys vertue of hys reſurrection, doeth pertayne vnto vs, he ſayeth, that not onelye the lyuynge haue felte it, but alſo the deade: and not onely the fayethful, but alſo the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleuyng, and rebels. It is true, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the matter requireth: that we muſte diſtinguyſhe we ſe that he ſpeaketh but of the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d kind: but that hindereth not, but that he ſpeaketh fy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>¶ Therfore the ſence is thys, the vertue of Chriſtes redemption, hathe appeared vnto the ſoules of theym that be deade, as well to the beleuynge, as vnto the vnbeleuyng, But when he muſte ſpeake in ſpeciall, he leaueth the fyrſte.</p>
                  <p>☞ Notwythſtandynge to the ende that we do not diſpute touchynge the ſence, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is no nead concernyng the preſent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, onely I aſke thys queſtion of theſe good people, whether the ſpirites, of whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doeth ſpeake be lyuynge ſoules or no? Moreouer he addeth an other ſentence, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che to yet more cleare, that is, that the goſpel was preached vnto the dead, that they ſhold be condempned in the fleſhe, as touchynge to men: but ſhoulde lyue to God in the ſpirite. We ſe that he doeth ſubiect the bodye onely
<pb facs="tcp:11396:60"/> vnto death, reſeruyng the ſoule alyue.</p>
                  <p>☞ The lyke was ſhewed before by Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: where, in diſcouerynge mannes death, he ſayeth, He doeth ſeperate the fault far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bodye, vntyll the earth do returne to hy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

If they gloſe, and ſaye that thys worde ſpirite, doeth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifye but lyfe, there is not ſo lyttle a chylde, whyche ſerth not, that, that is a corruptinge of the texte.</p>
                  <p>If there were none other teſtimonye but thys ſentence of Moyſes, where he ſayeth, that God is the God of Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob, aboute three hundred yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theyr death, it ſhoulde be ſufficiente to ſuche as woulde not be contentious.</p>
                  <p>But if there be any opiniatoure whiche wyl agayne ſay it, then wyll the expoſition why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che oure Sauiour Ieſus Chriſte, maketh v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon theſe wordes, take awaye all doubtes. That is, that hys father is not the God of the deade, but of the lyuyng.</p>
                  <p>¶ I knowe theyr anſwere is, that the dead be called lyuynge, bycauſe of the hope of the reſurrection. But that is nothynge. For ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge that the Patriarckes were deade, at that tyme when Moyſes ſpake, it foloweth that they lyued in a better lyfe.</p>
                  <p>And therefore Saynte Luke addeth that they do all lyue vnto God, ſignifiynge that the Lorde doeth mayntayne hys in lyfe, by hys grace and vertue.</p>
                  <p>Vnto which agreeth this ſaying of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle.

                  <p>There is no doubte but that theſe white garmentes, do ſignifie begynnyng of glorye whiche God doeth geue vnto the martiers, whyle thy tarrye for the daye of iudgement. For that is no newe thynge in the ſcripture, as whan Daniell ſayde, that he ſawe the Lorde clothed in a longe white robe. And Ieſus Chriſte was ſo in hys tranſfigurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the mount of Tabor. The Aungel al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, whiche apered to the women by the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, was clothed in a white robe. So were the aungelles whiche appered to the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb facs="tcp:11396:61"/> after the aſcencion of the Lorde Ieſus as much is ſayed of the Aungel whiche ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the Cornelius the Cneturien. Final lye, in the parable of the prodigall ſonne: it is ſayde that whan he was retourned, hys father commaunded to brynge hym hys beſt robe, in ſygne of Ioye and faſtynge. We ſe therefore, howe much thys doeth repugne a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gaynſte the erroure of the Anabaptiſtes, whyche in the place of whyte robes, woulde geue pyllowes to the ſoules to make them ſlepe.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer; in that it is ſayed, that the ſoules crye, axynge vengaunce of God, it is declared that they ſlepe not. For thys crye, cannot be expounded as the crye of Abelles bloud: bycauſe the deſire whych the holy ſou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les haue, is ther expreſſed. Thys is ſufficiente<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye comfirmed vnto vs, by the hiſtorye of La<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zarus, where it is ſayed that hys ſoule was borne by the aungelles of God, in to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of Abraham. And the ſoule of the riche man wente in to hell.</p>
                  <p>They thynke that they haue a fayre ſoluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and wel coloured, whan they do anſwere that it is a parable, that is to ſaye, an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and not a ſtorye</p>
                  <p>But I axe them, where they haue ſene it in holye ſcripture, that in a ſimple parable or ſimilitude the proper name of a manne hath bene expreſſed, as it is here.</p>
                  <p>And euen thus haue all the doctours of the churche vnderſtande that a place, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

Oure Lorde ſayth, that the ſoule of Lazarus, was borne by hys aungelles, in to the boſome of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and that ther, it receyued Ioye &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacion.</p>
                  <p>☞ On the otherſyde, he ſayeth that the ſoule of the rich infidle, did ſuffer maruelous tormentes in hell. He ſayeth that there is a greate diſtaunce betwene the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If the ſoulles haue no felynge after death, of good nor euyll, what ſhoulde thys narracion of the Lorde be, but a fable, and as a tale of the boke of Melluſine?</p>
                  <p>Therefore thys tergiuerſation of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſtes is a blaſphemye, which diſhono<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth the Lord Ieſus, as thoughe he had told vs a vayne tale to no purpoſe.

By thys word paradice, we nede not to imagen that he woulde ſpecifye a certayne place: but onely the Ioye and felicitie which they haue that liue with him. This is plaine that Ieſus Chriſte doeth not ſende thys poer ſynner to the daye of reſurrection: but doeth aſſigne him the ſelfe ſame daye, to liue
<pb facs="tcp:11396:62"/> eternallye in his companye.</p>
                  <p>The Anabaptiſtes to trifel out thys place do alledge that whiche is ſayed in a nother place, that a thouſande yeres are as one day before the Lorde. Whiche thinge we graunt vnto them, but thys muſte we conſider, that when God ſpeaketh vnto men, he frameth hys ſpeache, accordynge vnto their capiaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye. In ſuche wyſe, that you ſhall neuer finde in the ſcripture, that God hath at any time ſayed: I wyll thys daye do thys, meanynge that he wyll do it a thouſande yeres after.</p>
                  <p>In ſuche maner whan Ionas ſhewed the Niniuites, that after fortye dayes their Citye ſhoulde periſhe, it hadde bene greate folye for them, to haue vnderſtanded fortye thouſand yeres.</p>

                  <p>Moreouer after theyr ſayinge, we myghte conclude y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they, whole ſinnes Ieſus Chriſt hath forgeuen, ought to enter into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the daye of the reſurrection. For the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh of thre tymes, of the whyche the one, as I thynke, ſygnifieth the daye of the olde teſtamente, and the other ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the tyme whyche ſhal be from the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge of the worlde. Therefore it reſteth, that thys word to daye, muſt ſignifye the tyme in whych we be, whych is betwen the death of Ieſus Chriſte &amp; hys laſt commyng. And that they may the better knowe theyr beaſtlynes. If Ieſus Chriſt had promiſed heauen vnto the theſe for the day of Iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he ought to haue ſayd in the worlde to come, and not thys daye. For that is the ſcriptures maner of ſpeakynge. Who thinketh them not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by thys cleare reaſon? Yet is theyr im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency ſuche, that they brynge yet an other replycation, whyche is: that heauen is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed vnto the thefe, in lyke ſorte as deathe was pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced to Adam and Eua, in what daye ſo euer they ſhoulde eate of the fruyte whyche was forbydden theym. Nowe is it certayne that they dyed not the ſame day, but longe time after. I anſwere that in the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:11396:63"/> inſtaunce that Adam traunſgreſſed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God, he dyed as touchynge the ſoule. For as muche as he was alienate whyche was hys verye lyfe, and was made ſubiecte to bodily death. And thus, thoughe we ſhoulde receyue theyr gloſe: yet ſpyte of theyr teathe, ſhall we haue wonne this much of them, that in the ſelfe ſame daye, the thiefe was deliuered from the miſery, in whych A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam was fallen by hys offence. In ſumm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, we conclude, that euen as deathe beganne to raygne in Adam, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the daye of hys traunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion: euen ſo the thyefe, the ſame daye in whyche the promiſe was made vnto him: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to be reſtored into the beatitude of heauen.</p>
                  <p>We ſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> S Paule liued in this hope, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſayed, that he deſyered to be loſed to lyue wyth Chriſte. Fyrſt he vſeth an apte ſpeach, in ſayinge that the fayethfull man thorowe deathe is deliuered frome the bandes of hys bodye, as in an other place he doeth more clearlye expreſſe it. Further he addeth, that his deſyre is to be with the Lord Chriſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hys ſoule ſhall be ſeperated from the bodye.</p>
                  <p>And in dede, if it be not thys, theſe wordes whiche he ſpeaketh in an other place can not be true that there is neyther lyfe nor deathe whyche can ſeperate vs from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:11396:64"/> if our earthly houſe of the tabernacle of our bodye were deſtroyed, we haue a buildynge in heauen by God, whych is not made with handes. Therefore beynge in thys taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, we morne as beyng greaued, not that we deſyre to be vnclothed: but clothed agayne, that our mortalitie myght be ſwallowed vp of lyfe. Notwythſtandynge we be alwayes of good courage, knowinge that whylſe we be in our bodyes, we be as ſtraungers frome God, bycauſe we walke by fayeth and not by ſyghte,</p>
                  <p>¶ But we haue thys confidence, and deſyre to be ſeperat from the body, and to be preſent wyth God, bycauſe there is made mention there, of the daye of iudgemente. The Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſtes do theyr indeuoure to wrape vp al there, that they myght drawe all the wordes of the Apoſtle vnto that daye. But they can not do ſo muche, but that the trueth wyll be yet more ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, to maintain it ſelfe againſt theyr falſe accuſations.</p>
                  <p>For the Apoſtle doth ſaye expreſly, that the fayethfull man departynge frome hys bodye goeth to God, from whom he was abſent in thys worlde. After that he addeth, that as well abſente, as preſent, we do our indeuour to pleaſe God, bycauſe we mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

That man is very obſtinate, and more then hardened, agaynſte all reaſon, whyche wyll not conſente vnto theſe wordes. Nowe is it ſo, that the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſtes, in place where ſaynte Paule ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that by death we approche to God, do
<pb facs="tcp:11396:64"/> make vs beleue that wee retule and be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of then in thys preſente lyfe.</p>
                  <p>☞ That ſo it is, it is wrytten that he whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che beleueth in the ſonne of God, ſhall not come into co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation: but is already gone from death vnto lyfe. If lyfe euerlaſtyng be alreadye be gonne in vs, what abſurditye is it to ſaye, that in death there is interruption If we be already entred into the kyngdome of God, for what cauſe ſhoulde we be made go oute agayne by death, or at the leſte, made go backewarde as the ſea Crabbes?</p>
                  <p>The kyngedome of God is in you, ſayeth the Lorde Ieſus, what meaneth thys, but that we haue already the rote of lyfe, whyche can not be extynguyſhed? And that is it whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che in an other place he ſayeth. Thys is the wyll of my father, that whoſoeuer doeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in the ſonne, ſhall not peryſhe: but hathe euerlaſtynge lyfe, and I wyll rayſe hym vp the laſte daye.</p>
                  <p>☞ Alſo, who ſo euer eateth my fleſhe, and drynketh my bloude, hathe euerlaſtynge lyfe, and I wyll rayſe hym vp at the laſte daye. Note thys that he doth promiſe vnto vs .ii. thynges, euerlaſtynge lyfe and reſurrection</p>
                  <p>The Anabaptiſtes do take the one of theſe membres, &amp; leaue the other: as if they mighte be deuided.</p>
                  <p>He ſpeaketh yet more playnely in an other place, ſayinge. I am the reſurrection &amp; lyfe, he that beleueth in me though he were dead, he ſhall lyue: and who ſo euer lyueth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leueth in me, he ſhall neuer dye.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11396:65"/>
                  <p>Alſo, who ſo euer kepeth my word, ſhal neuer ſe deth I prai you, is it poſſible to ſpeke more playnly the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thys. And ſhuld a chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre more ſtronger teſtimonies to ſettle hys conſcience wyth? Peraduenture ſome man wyll obiecte, that thys is not true but onelye of faythfull men. I graunte that, and for my parte, it ſufficeth me to inſtructe the chyldre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, what ſhall be theyr condition after death. Howe be it hereafter wyl I ſpeake of the reprobate.</p>
                  <p>But here we ſe what Ieſus Chriſte doth promiſe vnto vs, if we be his. That in the middell of death, our ſpirituall lyfe ſhall not be interrupted. But that more is, ſaint Paul declareth that it is euen then, that it begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be in hys moſte ſtrength. As our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde man, ſayeth he, is corrupted, ſo is the inwarde man renued from daye to daye. By theſe wordes he declareth, that as thys pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent lyfe doeth declyne and become corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo the lyfe of the ſoule increaceth and is fortified more and more. Therfore it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this ſentence, to eſteme that the ſoule is que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ched whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the corporal lyfe taketh end.</p>
                  <p>I wyll yet deduce this argumente further. We muſt daylye encreaſe and profite in the Lorde, auauncynge oure ſoules alwayes to approche vnto hym, as if we ſtepped thys daye one pace, and to morowe an other. Or as if we dyd aſcende by ſteppes.</p>
                  <p>Nowe is it ſayed for thys preſente tyme, that we do walke in the bryghtneſſe of hys face. Alſo, that hys ſpirite doeth beare vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde,
<pb facs="tcp:11396:65"/> that we be hys chyldren. If it ſo be, that in death, we do leſe thys bryghtnes, and confidence whyche the holy Goſt geueth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, howe ſhall we then aduaunce oure ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues? Lykewyſe Saynte Paule ſayeth, that thought we haue oure conuerſation in thys worlde, yet is our habitation in heauen,</p>
                  <p>Let vs ſe if death maye dryue vs out of the kyngedome of God, wherein we had oure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bydyng before, thorowe hope It is true that thys mortall bodye is to vs as a pryſon, to thruſte downe oure ſoule ſo lowe, as captiue to earthly thynges.</p>
                  <p>☞ Therefore is it mete that when ſhe is gone forth of ſuche a ſeruitude into libertye, that ſhe be more diſpoſed to conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plate God more familiarly. And when ſhe is lyghtened of ſuche a burthen, that ſhe be more chereful to lifte hyr ſelfe vp vnto God. It is therfore to greate a beaſtelynes to laye theym downe ſofte, as do the Anabaptiſtes, to make them ſlepe vnto the day of the reſurrection. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit theyr erroure is yet better conuinced, by that the ſcripture doeth declare touchynge our regeneration.</p>
                  <p>For when it pleaſeth God to call vs into the participation of hys grace: he ſayth that he maketh vs newe creatures. How is that? In that by the vertue of hys worde and of hys ſpirite, he mortifyeth the corruption of oure nature, makynge vs to be borne agayne to liue in hys kyngdome. Let vs nowe heart what is the operation of the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in vs. Saynt Paule goynge aboute to

                  <p>☞ As touchynge the worde, Saynte Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpeaketh yet more clearlye, ſayinge that it is a ſede of immortalitye, yea an incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible ſede, whyche God hathe put into vs, to exempte vs from that condition wherein we be by nature, whyche is as Eſaias ſayeth, that all fleſhe is haye, and all the glory of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is as the floure of the graſſe, bycauſe that when the ſpirite of God doth blowe on ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he is by and by wythered and dryed, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth wholy downe.</p>
                  <p>Nowe, after that the Prophete had thus ſpoken of vs, he added by and by, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, that the worde of God abideth for euer. Saynte Peter doeth aledge thys place, and ſheweth that thys eternitie of the worde of God is ſhewed in vs, bycauſe that by the ſame we are borne agayne, hauinge it in our ſoules for an incorruptible ſeede the whyche neuer rolleth nor withereth. What is it that maye be replyed agaynſte thys, whyche ſhall not be thynges apparant, and already reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, for we beinge regenerate by the grace of God, are broughte into hys kyngedome, to

                  <p>To reſolue thys matter, there is nothinge more mete not more certayne, then to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what coniunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; vnitie we haue w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our Sauioure Ieſus. Fyrſte we knowe that in Baptiſme we be entexed into hys bodye, to be verily hys membres, and to fele in vs ſuch an effect of hys vertue, as the braunches of a tre do of theyr rote. For we are ſo vnited vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to hym, that we are made one ſelf ſubſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And we nede not aledge any other probatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then that whyche he hathe ſpoken wyth hys owne mouth.</p>
                  <p>As I lyue ſayeth he, ſo ſhall you lyue. Now we knowe that the lyfe of Ieſus Chriſte is not temporall, nor yet by interpoſition of tyme. Therefore if we lyue as he liueth, it fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that it muſte be wythout ende. For it was neceſſarye that he ſhoulde dye wyth vs. And thys is it that he ſpake before: He that eateth my fleſh, &amp; drinketh my bloud, he dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in me, &amp; I in hym. If Ieſus Chriſt dwel in vs, it foloweth that forthwith lyfe dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in vs: accordyng to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which he ſpake be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore, as the father hathe lyfe in hym ſelfe: ſo hath he geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto his ſon, to haue life in him ſelfe. It is eaſy to ſe that the Anabaptiſtes neuer taſted howe wee be ioyned to oure Lorde Ieſus.</p>
                  <p>For the one principle is ſuffitiente to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe their falſe &amp; pernitious opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge this fantaſtical ſlepe whyche they do attribute vnto the ſoules.</p>
                  <p>For we ſe the deductio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which .ſ. Paul hath

Therefore let vs holde vs faſt by that whych Saynte Paule hath ſayed, that we be dead touchyng the world, and that our lyfe is hyd with Chriſt in God.</p>
                  <p>Nowe, by thys he ſignifieth that whiche in an other place he ſayeth. I lyue no more, but Chriſte lyueth in me Let vs hold I ſay, thys reſolution, that we hauyng one inſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable coniunction wyth oure Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, be partakers of the lyfe whyche is permanent in hym.

                  <p>¶ It is true, that there is thys difference, that in hym death is wholly vanquyſhed, in vs onelye in parte.

And fyrſt I proteſt, that I wyl ſpeke therof more ſoberly then many woulde. For I knowe what curioſitie there is in manye whyche woulde that a man ſhoulde deſcribe it vnto them vnto the vttermoſte, euen vnto the chambers and cabyns where the ſoules be, abydynge the daye of iudgement.</p>
                  <p>They whych woulde be fed with ſuche fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, ſhall be deceyued, if they ſeke theym at me. For I had leuer kepe my ſelfe to the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of the ſcripture, to ſhewe that which is expediente to knowe, then to wander a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode in the ayre, to appeare ſubtyle. Nowe the Lorde forſeynge that it was not needful for vs to haue a more ample vnderſtandyng of this matter, was content to teach vs ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye, that when our ſoules be departed from theyr bodyes, they do notwythſtandyng lyue in hym, abyding the accompliſhment of their beatitude and glory, in the daye of the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as ſhall be hereafter ſhewed.

                  <p>But to procede more plainely, let vs begin at the diſtinction, which is betwene the ſoules of the fayethfull, and the ſoules of the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apoſtle ſayd in the epiſtle vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hebrues, that vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which had caſt of Ieſus Chriſte, &amp; had wyllingly turned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>And thys is alſo teſtified by Saynte Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and S Iude, where they ſaye, that God hath not ſpared hys owne Aungels, whyche fell from theyr originall: but hath caſte them into darcke pryſons, kepyng them ſhutte vp, to preſerue them vnto the greate day. In de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarynge vnto vs the condition of the deuyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, they ſhewe vnto vs lykwyſe, what is the condition of the wycked. For it is one ſelfe reaſon. Thus we ſe that the ſoule of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dele, beynge departed frome the bodye, is as a malefactoure whyche hathe alreadye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued the ſentence of condempnation, and obydeth the houre that he ſhoulde be ledde forthe to the gallowes to be put in execution</p>

                  <p>After deathe it is not ſo. For God holdeth them as in chaynes, in ſuch wyſe that they ſe well what punyſhemente is prepared for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oute of whyche there is no waye to eſcape. Therefore they be in extreme angwyſhe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bydynge the execution of theyr iudgment. It is not in vs to determine the place wher they be, and we nede not to care for it.</p>

Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowyng thys, let vs vnderſtand that in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme oure pharao is plunged in the ſea: that is to ſaye, oure olde man is mortified, and we are buried wyth Chriſte, by that meanes made fre from the bondage of ſyn. But from thens we go in to the deſerte, in whyche we haue oure conuerſation durynge thys mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall lyfe, For we are poore and indigente, but for that the Lorde geueth vnto vs daye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye hys graces, as he dyd cauſe manna to raygne from heauen vnto the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell, whan death commyth we do enter in to the lande of promyſſion whyche thynge is not done wythout greate difficultye.

<pb facs="tcp:11396:73"/> whych walke not after the fleſh. And in dede if deathe ſhoulde haue dominion ouer the Soules of the fayethfull, the grace of God ſhould not haue his raigne, which importeth lyfe, as he ſayth: but rather the lawe of god ſhoulde exercyſe hyr power ouer them, why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is contrarye to the whole doctrine of the ſcripture.</p>
                  <p>¶ They do alſo abuſe theim ſelues w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thys that oftentymes thys worde ſleepe, is token for death: as where it is ſayed of ſaynt Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan, that he fel a ſlepe in the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Lazarus our frend ſlepeth. Againe ſorowe you not for them that ſleepe. And in dede this manner of ſpeach, is more freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the Hyſtories of the Byble, then anye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I anſwere, that thys ſlepe appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth nothynge vnto the Soule, but oughte wholie to be vnderſtanded of the body. For ther are two ſpeaches, whyche do vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de in one ſelfe ſence, to ſleepe wyth hys fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to be wyth hys fathers.</p>
                  <p>Nowe when it is ſayed that a man is put vnto hys fathers, it is playne that it is ment of hys Sepulchre I woulde haue no manne beleue thys, excepte I can proue my ſayinge by good wytnes of the ſcripturs. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iob ſayed: Beholde, I ſlepe in duſte, he ment not that hys ſoule ſhould ſlepe ther. So when he ſayth in an other place, that al men ſhal ſlepe in the duſte togyther, and that the wormes ſhall couer them: it maye not be vnderſtande out of the bodyes. A lyke meanynge is in theſe wordes of Dauid, wher he ſayeth, that
<pb facs="tcp:11396:74"/> he was lyke vnto the dead ſleapinge in then Sepulchres. And Eſayas ſpeakyng to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchodonoſor ſayeth. All other kynges haue ſlepte in theyr glorye, and were putte into theyr places: but thou arte caſte oute of thy Sepulchre.</p>
                  <p>☞ Therefore in a ſome, we ſe that thys worde ſleepe, is by ſimilitude applied vnto the bodyes, whyche are wythoute mouynge when the ſoules are ſeperate from them. And thys is a maner of ſpeakynge, whyche the Painyms alwayes vſed. And thereoute commeth alſo, that we call the place of buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, a Cimyterie, whyche doeth ſygnifye a place of ſleapynge, not that oure elders, dyd thynke, that the ſoules were there a ſleape, but bycauſe the bodyes be there layed to reſt in theyr Sepulchres, as in beddes. A lyke vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtandynge muſte we haue, of a certayne place in Iob, where wyth they myghtilye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende them ſelues, where he ſayeth, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter manne is once fallen a ſlepe, that he ſhall not walke, nor ryſe vp tyll the Heauen be chaunged.</p>
                  <p>☞ They do lykewyſe make them ſelues a buckeler, with a ſentence of Salomon, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che maketh more againſte them, then anye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in al holy ſcripture. And in dede I wold not nowe brynge it forthe to ſerue my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, were it not that they do ſo impudently vſe it as though it made for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The words be theſe.</p>
                  <p>☞ I haue ſayed in my herte of the ſonnes of menne, that God hathe ſhewed them lyke
<pb facs="tcp:11396:74"/> vnto beaſtes. Therefore the death of manne is ſuche, as the deathe of a beaſte, and there condition is lyke. The one doeth breath like as doeth the other, and they do dye after one maner, and man hathe nothynge more then haue the beaſtes. Boeth are ſubiect vnto va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and do returne into one place. They come from the earth, and ſhal to the earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. Whoe knoweth whether the ſpirite of men doeth aſcende, and the ſpirite of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes doeth deſcende?</p>
                  <p>To thys I anſwer, as I haue before ſayd that Salomon could not ſpeake more expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly for vs. For goynge aboute to reproue the vanitie of mannes ſence, he ſayth that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by hys naturall reaſon, and by that whyche he ſeeth can not comprehend wherein he doeth differ from beaſtes. And chiefely what excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencye he hath aboue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after death. For the immortalitye of Soules is a thinge whyche doeth ſurmounte hys capacitie.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ſeinge that man is reproued as vayne, bycauſe he knoweth not that his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite doeth aſcende, that is to ſaye, is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, where as the ſpirites of beaſtes doth go into corruption and peryſhe: we muſt nedes conclude that the true wyſedome is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehende the immortalitye of the Soules.</p>
                  <p>Thys text is lyke that whyche he addeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non after, that a man knoweth not whyther he be beloued, or hated of God, but that this thynge is ſecrete and hydde, bycauſe all thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges come indifferentlye to good and euyll. Nowe ſeyng al thynges are vncerten, I are
<pb facs="tcp:11396:75"/> whether the fayethfull man, when he is in aduerſitie and tribulation, ſhall thynke that God doth hate hym? It is very true, that he doeth not hate hym. For thys promyſe is made vnto him, that it is for his health, that he myght conforte hym ſelfe and reioyce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge ſure that tribulation is rather a ſigne of Goddes fatherly loue, then of hys hatred But Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeaketh of the opinion whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che we might haue after mannes vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge. Therefore are all men vanitye. We muſte therefore haue recourſe to God and to hys word. For a little after he ſheweth what commeth vnto them that be in thys fantaſye that is, that theyr hertes are fylled wyth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlyneſſe and contempte of God: bycauſe they haue thys prouerbe. That a quicke dog is better then a deade Lyon. Nowe he hym ſelfe in the ende of his boke doth ſhew what we oughte to thynke touchynge thys matter That is, that the bodye doeth returne vnto the earth whence it came: and the ſpirite do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth go to God whyche gaue it.</p>
                  <p>They do pryncipally grounde them ſelues vpon that the ſcripture ſayeth, that we ſhall receyue in the laſte daye euerye manne accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge to hys worckes. For they do reaſon thus. Seynge that God, when he ſpeaketh of our beatitude, and of the lyfe euerlaſtyng doeth remitte vs vnto the laſt daye: And co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye wyſe when he threateneth the wycked he ſayeth that he wyll take vengeaunce in that day, it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that vnto that tyme the good ſhall not receyue theyr rewarde, nor the
<pb facs="tcp:11396:75"/> wycked ſhall be punyſhed. Otherwyſe if were in vayne ſayed: that ther ſhall be ſaued all thoſe that are wrytten in the boke of lyfe.</p>
                  <p>Alſo that it ſhall be ſayed vnto the electe, Come and poſſeſſe the kingedome. Therfore do they conclude, that ſeynge we ſhal not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the poſſeſſion of our ſaluation vnto the daye of the laſte reſurrection: that in the meane tyme oure ſoules do ſlepe, I haue no maner of Ioye of theyr beatitude.</p>
                  <p>I anſwere that it is not a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce For thoughe the Soule be not in glorye: yet doth it not folowe, that they do not lyue in God, whylſe they do abyde the reuelation of the ſame</p>
                  <p>And for a more ful ſolution of thys place, I woulde the readers ſhoulde reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre what I haue before ſayed, that is, that our beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is alwayes in the waye, vnto that day. We all agree in thys, that the perfection of oure beatitude, is to be perfytelye Ioyned to God, And it is the marke whereunto all the promyſes of God do ſend vs. For that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che in tymes paſſed was ſayed to Abraham, is alſo directed vnto vs, That is, that God is oure rewarde. Thys is then the ende of our beatitude of our glory and health, to be all wholy to God, to poſſeſſe him, and that he be altogyther in vs.</p>
                  <p>Nowe is it ſo that thys thynge ſhall not be accomplyſhed before the day of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Therefore it is not wythout a cauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat it is called the day of health. It is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſayd, that we ſhal then poſſeſſe the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb facs="tcp:11396:76"/> of God, not that we ſhall not in parte poſſeſſe it before as nowe at thys preſente we do poſſeſſe it thorowe hope, but bycauſe that then we ſhall haue the full and perfecte Reuelation.</p>
                  <p>But to make ſhort, that whyche we haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſayed; myghte ſuffyce for the ſolution of theyr argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. That is, that we are alwaies in a wayte and deſyre, vntyll Ieſus Chriſte do appeare in oure full Redemption, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue vs into the immortalitie and glorye of hys kyngedome. Neuertheleſſe in the meane whyle, we ceaſe not to haue our lyfe hydd in hym before God as ſayeth ſaynt Paule.</p>
                  <p>☞ It ſhoulde appeare that we had ſuffiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently anſwered vnto them, touchyng the day of the reſurrection: were it not that they do proſecute the matter further, bryngyng forth the ſentence of ſaynte Paule, where he ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that we be of all men moſte miſerable, if we ſhall not ryſe agayne.</p>
                  <p>They ſaye that thys canne in no wyſe be true, if we be bleſſed before the reſurrection. I anſwere that Saynte Paule had reſpecte vnto the ende of the hope of the fayethfull, that is, that at the daye of the reſurrection, they ſhall receyue that whych God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed vnto theym, and ſo if there were no Reſurrection, they ſhoulde be voyde of all theyr hope.</p>
                  <p>☞ We ſaye alſo, that the Soules of the fayethfull are bleſſed in waytynge for that daye, but that is thorowe theyr lokynge and
<pb facs="tcp:11396:76"/> waytyng for it, whych beynge fruſtrate and vaine, it muſt nedes folowe that they are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy. Seynge that all the bleſſednes of the chyldren of God proceadeth and hangeth of thys, that in the daye of the reſurrection they ſhall be lyke vnto God, and inioye theyr he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage. It is no maruaile if ſaynte Paule do ſaye, that they ſhoulde be more vnhappy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reſte of the worlde, if there ſhall be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</p>
                  <p>☞ And in dede, in one maner ſence, he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth theſe two thynges: that there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and that our hope ſhould be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in thys worlde. I doubte not but that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man ſeeth playnelye, that thys ſentence of ſaynte Paule is nothynge agaynſte vs. For he ſayeth, that if we be deceyued in our hope whyche we haue of the reſurrection: that we be vnhappye. And we ſaye that the ſoules of the fayethfull are ryght happye thorowe the ſame hope, wythout whiche we confeſſe that they can haue no Ioye nor bleſſedneſſe. In thys there is no contradiction.</p>
                  <p>☞ They obiecte yet more againſte vs, that which is wrytten in the epiſtle to the Hebru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Auncient fathers, how that thei de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted in fayeth, wythoute receyuynge the promiſes: but ſaluted theym a farre of, and confeſſed them ſelues to be ſtraungers vpon the earthe.</p>
                  <p>☞ Nowe in ſaying thus, they do ſignifye that they ſoughte theyr heritage and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall countrye, in that they had no mynde of
<pb facs="tcp:11396:77"/> that contrei fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whens they came: they might haue returned: but they deſired a better: that is to ſaye from heauen. Thys texte is wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly depraued by them, thorowe falſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in that they do refer thys to the preſente tyme: where the Apoſtell ſpeketh of the tyme whan the Patriarches were conuerſaunte in thys worlde. Howe be it touchynge the purpoſe of oure matter, I am ryghte well contente to alowe their gloſe. They make their argumente thus, if Abraham and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fathers do deſire the heauenly heritage, than they haue it not yet. I replye to the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary, that if they haue a deſire, than do they lyue, and haue relynge of good and euyll. Where is their ſlepyng than? Thus we ſe that they be contrary to them ſelues lyke li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell chyldren. Touchynge the reſte, I wyll well the Apoſtle ſayeth afterwarde, that all the auncient fathers, haue not yet receyued that whych in thys worlde they loked for, by<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe God hath ordeyned, that they w th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vs ſhoulde not be made perfect. And this is it that we ſaye, that all the conſolation whych the fayethfull ſoules haue, is reduced to thys glorious immortalitye, in which, we ſhall all at one tyme, be gathered together, whan Ieſus Chriſte ſhal apere in iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Theſe places which here after I wyll recite ſhal declare, howe theſe phantaſticalles do kepe together al the cauillations that they canne, and that impudentlye, to haue ſome apparence to colour their errour. If the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les (ſay they) beynge ſeperate from their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies

But I knowe that it were vaynt to tarye for anye good ſolution of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Touchynge vs oure anſwere is eaſye, that whyche Sayncte Paule ſpake of hym ſelfe is common to all fayethfull men. That is, that it is profitable for vs to dye, &amp; that it is for oure aduantage to be wyth Chriſte. And yet notwythſtandynge, he ſayeth that God whan he healed Hepaphroditus of his ſyck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and deliuered hym from death, had pitie on hym, allthoughe he were of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the fayethfull. The Anabaptiſtes do ſaye that thys is a crueltye if the ſoules do liue after death.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:11396:78"/> wepte for the loſſes that they hadde by her death. Therefore let vs byde faſte by thys, that the Lorde doeth alwayes vnto vs a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler grace whan he maketh vs to lyue, and dye to hym.</p>
                  <p>☞ Let vs come to the teſtimonies whyche they aledge of Dauid, althoughe I be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to reherce them, bycauſe they do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe them ſo chyldyſhelye. But yet muſte I reherſe them, bycauſe they go about to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue the ſimple with them. They do aledge thys ſentence: I haue ſayed, you are goddes and ſonnes of the moſte hygheſt yet ſhal you dye lyke men.</p>
                  <p>They do expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, thus that the faythful are there called goddes: but yet do they dye lyke the reprobate, and that there condition is lyke vntyl the daye of iudgemente. But we haue the expoſicion of Chriſte, that in that place, is mencion made of princes, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteres of Iuſtice whiche haue the tytle of god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des: bycauſe that in there eſtate, they are as hys lyuetenauntes. And thoughe oure ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oure Ieſus Chriſte had ſpoken nothynge thereof, yet the phraſe of ſcripture doeth declare it plainelye. And the texte it ſelfe is ſo playne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it beareth hys gloſe wyth it. For, there are reproued all ſuche as exerciſe tiranny and iniquiti, and it is ſayed to them that they muſte dye, and be depriued of that dignitye whyche they haue, and muſte geue an accompte to God as well as the leſte of all.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11396:78"/>
                  <p>They aledge alſo thys texte: put not youre truſte in men, the ſpirite of man goethe, and returnethe into hys earthe, and in that daye ſhall periſhe al their cogitations. They take thys worde ſpirite for wynde, as thoughe ther were none other ſoule in man. Than do they make their argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Thus, if mannes cogitations do periſhe, it muſte folowe that the ſoul doeth ſlepe, or elſe that it is nothing I anſwere, that the ſpirite of man, doeth ſig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifye an other thynge than breth, as I haue ryghts well proued before. But were it ſo, that thys worde in thys place were taken in ſuche a ſignificacion, as it is taken in ſome other places: yet ſhoulde it not therefore fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe that man hath none other ſoule but breth.</p>
                  <p>Touchynge that it is ſayde, that the cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacions do periſhe: that doeth importe none other thyng, but that the enterpriſes of men are diſſipate by death, and vaniſhe as ſmoke as it is ſayde in a nother place, that the deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of ſynners ſhall periſhe, to ſignifie that they ſhall not come to ther effecte Therefore Dauid ſayth not, that men ſhal thyncke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge after ther death: but he meaneth that all ther delyberacions ſhall come to nothing They aledge an other place all moſte lyke thys: he hath remembered that they are but fleſh, a ſpirit that goeth and retorneth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne. Nowe I graunte, that in this place this worde ſpirite doeth ſignifie wynde, or breath.</p>
                  <p>But I do denye, that this place doth make
<pb facs="tcp:11396:79"/> any thyng to the confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their errour For by thys maner of ſpeache, the prophete woulde expreſſe the fragilitye of oure eſtate and condition, and the ſhortenes of mannes lyfe. It is ſayed in the hyſtorye of Iob, that man is as a flour ſprynging out of the earth whyche in continente wythereth, and as a ſhadowe paſſeth awaye.</p>
                  <p>☞ Eſaias commaundeth all preachers to crye, that all fleſhe is but graſſe. If the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſtes do oute of thys conclude, that the ſoule wythereth away: they do ſe more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye then dyd Saynte Peter, whyche proueth that the ſoules of the fayethfull are immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall: bycauſe the Prophete immediatlye ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that the word of God abideth for euer.</p>
                  <p>There is a lyke reaſon in thys, whyche is ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in an other Pſalme. As a father hath pitye of hys chyldren, euen ſo hath the Lorde had pitye of hys ſeruauntes. For he knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whereof we are made. He doeth remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre that wee be duſte, that oure dayes be as graſſe wherof the floures doth quykcly wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther awaye. That the ſpirite paſſeth in vs, and tarieth not, and knoweth no more hys place. In all theſe ſentences, let vs note that man is admoniſhed of hys frayltye, chyeflye when God wythdraweth hys hande, and hys vertue from hym: that he ſhould knowe that he is nothynge, and leſſe then nothyng, if that God do not kepe and preſerue him bi hys grace. And in dede when we ſaye that the ſoules are immortal. We intende not by that ſayinge to derogate anye thynge frome
<pb facs="tcp:11396:79"/> Goddes title, &amp; the whyche as Saynt Paule ſayeth, is onelye immortall. But we rather thynke it a blaſphemy ſo to attribute immor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>talitie vnto the ſoule, as if ſhe by hyr propre vertue dyd ſubſyſt. But in the meane whyle we muſte conſider what propertye and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture God hathe geuen to the ſoules: and that is by hys hande to ſubſiſte, for to be in beatitude immortall, or in malediction.</p>
                  <p>☞ But they thynke that they haue a verye ſtronge weapen, of thys whych is ſpoken in an other Pſalme: wilte thou do a miracle in rayſynge vp the deade, that they may prayſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>the. Shall any man in the graue ſhew forth thy mercye, or thy ryghtuouſnes in the Land of forgetfulnes?</p>
                  <p>Agayne, the dead prayſe not the, oh Lord, neyther yet all they that do diſcende into the graue. But we that lyue ſhal prayſe God. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, what profit ſhal there be in my bloud when I ſhall deſcend into corruption? Shal the duſte prayſe the, or ſhall it ſhewe forthe thy veritye. Alſo that whyche Ezechyas ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in hys ſonge? The graue ſhal not prayſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>the, and the death ſhall not geue glorye to the They whyche diſcende downe ſhall not loke for thy verity. The lyuynge, the lyuynge ſhal confeſſe. The father ſhall declare vnto hys ſonne thy veritye. For ſolution hereof, there are two thynges to be noted: the one is, that by deathe, we maye not ſymple vnderſtande the commune death by whyche we muſte all paſſe: but a death whyche is a puniſhemente expreſſed, and ſigne of the wrathe of God, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:11396:80"/> whych doeth emporte a reiection of men, for deſtroye them vtterlye. The ſeconde where it is ſayed, that the dead ſhall not prayſe the, it is mente of that prayſe of God, whych is done among thoſe men whych haue felte his grace.</p>
                  <p>As touchynge the fyrſte, it is true that this worde hell doeth often times ſignify a graue as we haue alſo tranſlated it. But they whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che are exerciſed in the ſcripture, are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunte but that whyche I haue ſayed, is ſignified by theſe wordes deathe and graue. And that chyefly in the Pſalmes. Therefore thoſe whom God hath reiecte, and whom he chaſteth in hys wrath, not onelye touchynge theyr bodyes, but muche more touching their ſoules, are called deade, and the angwyſhe whyche they fele is called a graue, as when it is ſayed. Let the deathe come vpon theym, and let theym deſcende a lyue into the graue. Againe, Lorde God if thou ceaſe to helpe me, I ſhall be lyke vnto them that go downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the graue.</p>
                  <p>Agayne, Lorde thou haſt drawne my ſoule out of the graue, and haſt deliuered me from them whyche are layed in the graue. Againe, let ſynners be caſte into the graue, and all people whyche forget God. Agayne if God had not holpen me, my ſoule hadde dwelled in the graue. Againe, oure bones were ſcate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nere to the graue. Agayne, he hath placed me in an obſcure place like the deade.</p>
                  <p>As contrarye wyſe it is ſayed they lyue, to whom God ſheweth hys mercye.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11396:80"/>
                  <p>The Lord ſayth Dauid, in an other place, hath ordeyned benediction and euerlaſtynge lyfe, amonge hys people. Agayne, deliueryng theyr ſoules from death, and nouriſhyng the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in tyme of famine.</p>
                  <p>Agayne, God ſhall plucke the frome thy tabernacle, and thy rote frome the Lande of the lyuynge. Agayne, I ſhall pleaſe the Lord in the Lande of the lyuynge.</p>
                  <p>But ther is one text among the reſt, whych doeth ſo well expreſſe boeth meaninges, that it ſhall ſuffice vs, for altogyther. Shall man paye a pryce for hys Soule, that he may lyue euer? Shall he not ſe death, ſeynge that wiſe men do dye? Foles and wyſe menne ſaye I, ſhall dye togyther: they ſhall be layed in graue lyke ſhepe, and death ſhall deuour the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. but the ryghtuouſe ſhall haue rule ouer them in the mornynge: theyr ſtrength ſhall peryſhe in the Sepulchre, and theyr glorye ſhal vade and the Lorde ſhall drawe my ſoule from the power of the graue.</p>
                  <p>The ſome of thys Phalme is, that al ſuch as putte truſte in theyr rycheſſe or ſtrengthe ſhall all dye, as well the poore as the ryche. as well the fole as the wyſe: but he that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in God, ſhall be delyuered frome the graue. Theſe thyngs wel marked, we haue a ſolution for all the places whyche the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſtes do alledge.</p>
                  <p>☞ It is is therefore declared, howe the Sayntes beyng aſtoniſhed for the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of deathe, do deſyre God to wythdra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we theym.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11396:81"/>
                  <p>Howe commeth it that they haue ſuche an horrous? Let vs beholde al the enſamples of the fayethfull: we Reade not that they dyd make any greate complayntes or lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when the tyme was come, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould dye, but dyd ſubmit them ſelues, to the good wyll of God, in patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, I ſaye alſo Dauid and Ezechyas, Wherefore then haue they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſuche complaintes in the places aboue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged? But onely bycauſe in death they dyd conceyue the wrath and ſeueryte of God, the whyche dyd aſtonyſhe theym, and not wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Nowe there is no doubte, but that the man whyche fealeth the rygour of God, and is perſecuted by hys vengeaunce, canne not prayſe him: for as muche as we can not geue hym herty thankes, except we fele his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Secondelye, where it is ſayed in theſe places, that the dead do not prayſe God, that is not mente that they do not prayſe hym in in theyr mynde: but is ment, that they cannot tel hys praiſes vnto other.

Daued ſayeth not that he wyl prayſe the Lord only during this preſente life: but he promiſeth to do the ſame wythout ende. What meaneth he than in the other places? ſome man wil anſwere that he doeth promiſe to prayſe the Lorde whylſe he liueth.

Touchyng the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, they be the wordes of a man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſed wyth anguyſhe of conſcience, the which deſyreth of God, if he haue deſerued to be thruſte downe, that he maye be but once, as we haue a lyke exemple of Iob, where he ſay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth to God.

                  <p>There be yet other places in the hiſtorie of Iob whiche they do wreſte to theyr pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, whyche I wyll brieflye touche as they ſhall come to my memorie, the fyrſt is. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore

And this is the maner of all ſuche, as be compaſſed with greate anguyſhe and doloure. For if in the great heates of the ſomer we deſyred a great froſte, and agayne in wynter, hauyng forgot<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten how muche the beat did greue vs, would deſyre that it myght be very hotte, it were no greate meruayle though a vehement paſſion dyd dryue vs to ſuche a deſyre.

<pb facs="tcp:11396:82"/> There is alike reaſon in many other ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whiche he afterward ſpeketh, as be theſe whych do folowe.

                  <p>Wherefore to conclude by this, that the ſoule of man periſheth wyth the body, is not onely a moſt ſhamefull beaſtlynes, but alſo a moſte ſhameles boldenes Wherfore in this, and in al the reſte, I thinke I haue ſo euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye rproued all that whych the Anabaptiſtes do pretende, to geue coloure to theyr wycked opinion, that I maye well make an ende of thys matter.</p>
                  <p>I proteſted in the begynnyng, &amp; not with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out a cauſe, that myne intente was not to in treate of all the opinions whyche the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſtes do holde: for that were to entre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Foreſte whyche hath none ende.

I confeſſe therefore, that we ought not vily to eſteme the dethe of Godes ſeruantes, ſeinge it is precious in hys ſyght: and that theyre conſtancye and ſtedfaſtnes is no ſmale helpe to ſuccoure our infirmytye. But bycauſe we might often times be deceaued by thys, yf we loked no further: therfore muſt we come to the foundation with out whych we can haue no ſure iudgement, nor yet certaintye in thys behalfe. It is trewe, that the dethe of a man what ſoeuer he be, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be ſo precious, that it maye or ought in any thynge do preiudice to the verite of God, or can be auaylable to proue eronious and peruerſe doctryne.
